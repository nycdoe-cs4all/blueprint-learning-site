  <div class="article-content">
    <p>Computer Science and Me introduces students to the idea of computers and computing by posing questions such as “What is a computer?” and “How do computers work?" Students learn about the different parts of a computer and their functions (hardware, software). Students explore how computers work by identifying important aspects of computing such as algorithms, programming and abstraction in order to apply their new skills to a culminating final project. Teachers can choose to utilize an online project through the Scratch Jr. platform or an unplugged project that can be integrated into a content area.</p>
