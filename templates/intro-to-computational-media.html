    <p>Developed by the NYCDOE CS education team, the Introduction to Computational Media is a yearlong (108 hours) creative computing course for high schools using the open source Javascript library p5.js. By understanding how code can be a medium for creative expression, students will learn the fundamentals of computer science while designing and prototyping interactive projects that run on a browser. Additionally, students will learn how HTML/CSS elements can interact with p5.js to fully take advantage of developing content for a browser. This course has been implemented in NYC schools via <a href="http://cs4all.nyc/programs/sequences/">CS4Allâ€™s Software Engineering Program (SEP)</a>, revised by classroom teachers with guidance from the Processing Foundation, and aligns with the CS4All Blueprint for CS education that emphasizes a hands-on CS approach called creative computing. <a href="https://vimeo.com/251337307">Watch this video</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GUBt07OCJBdKlFc4QapACkI-1ucxB3TLLdpAOze52xA/edit?usp=sharing">view this fact sheet</a> for more information.</p>
