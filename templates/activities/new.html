                    Submitting a meaningful CS unit to the Blueprint is easy, just follow these steps:
                    <h3>Use Google Docs</h3>
                    <p>Make sure your content is in Google Docs. Google Drive makes it easy to convert many different document types into Google Docs. We use Google docs because many educators use it and it makes it easy for educators to copy your unit and make changes.</p>


                    <h3>Fetch</h3>
                    <!-- <h3>Review and Submit</h3> -->
                    <!-- <p>Once you’ve ensured you’ve got all your metadata in the document, please drop the link to the document in the submission form and click “Fetch”. The Blueprint site will retrieve and parse the document, looking specifically for the metadata from the previous step.</p> -->
                    <p>Please drop the link to the document in the submission form to the left and click “Fetch”. Make sure the link is public. Once the blueprint site has parsed your document, you will be able to preview how your unit will look on the Blueprint site.</p>

                    <h3>Provide Metadata</h3>
                    <p>Metadata will help educators find your unit. Once your document has been processed, a form will appear in the sidebar. Fill out the form to provide information about your unit.</p>

                    <p>Here is a list of the metadata fields:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><b>Title</b> -A descriptive name for your unit</li>
                      <li><b>Grade</b> - K-2, 3-5, 6-8, 9-12 (choose one)</li>
                      {# <li><b>Subject</b> - ELA, Math, Social Studies, Science, Art, Technology</li> #}
                      <li><b>Pacing</b> - in hours and minutes (7 hours, 30 minutes)</li>
                      <li><b>CS Concepts</b> - Select all relevant concepts. See Concepts section for concepts and subconcepts. (Abstraction - Pattern Recognition)</li>
                      <li><b>Topic Tags</b> - Select all relevant topic tags</li>
                      <li><b>Devices</b> - Select all relevant devices</li>
                      <li><b>Software</b> - Select all relevant software</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Submit</h3>
                    <p> Once you feel good about the look and the metadata associated with your unit, click “Submit”.</p>

                    <h3>Approval</h3>
                    <p>Your unit will be reviewed by the CS4All team to ensure it meets the requirements for a meaningful CS unit and is aligned to the needs of classroom educators.</p>

            </div>


            <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="contributing">
                <div class="col-md-10">
                  <!-- <h3>Introduction</h3>
                  <p>Every student in New York City will receive at least one meaningful unit of computer science (CS) instruction by 2025, at every grade band: K-2, 3-5, 6-8, and 9-12.</p>
                  <p>To help educators understand the criteria and see them in practice, the CS4ALL Blueprint provides sample units that are contributed by the creative computing community.</p> -->

                  <h3>Who should contribute?</h3>
                  <p>The Blueprint was built on the idea that an open approach to CS education would yield innovative educational materials that are timely and meaningful to students outside the classroom. Therefore CS educators of all backgrounds are highly encouraged to contribute new units or remix existing units.</p>
                  <p>Units currently published and in our review backlog are written by educators from different parts of the CS education community, including K-12 CS teachers, higher ed CS educators, teaching artists, and out-of-school educators.</p>

                  <h3>Finding a Collaborator</h3>
                  <p>Those without education experience may feel awkward writing “unit plans”. The CS4All team works with lots of great educators in the public and private education spaces. We can help facilitate connections directly or you can request to jump into our community of educators at cs4allteachers.slack.com by completing this form.</p>

                  <h3>Uh, what’s a “unit”?</h3>
                  <p>At a high level, a unit is a meaningful exploration of an unanswerable question, or an “essential question” in educator speak. Through the lessons, tasks, and projects in this exploration students learn the concepts and practices of a specific domain of knowledge.</p>
                  <p>The CS4All team has defined a meaningful computer science unit as:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>A creative application of computing with connections to each student's interests, such as other academic subjects, or real-world scenarios.</li>
                    <li>A performance task that assesses students on their ability to think through open-ended tasks.</li>
                    <li>A Hands-on experience with:</li>
                      <ul>
                        <li>all three CS practices: Analyzing, Prototyping, and Communicating.</li>
                        <li>at least three of five CS concepts; Abstraction, Algorithms, Programming, Data, and Networks.</li>
                      </ul>
                </ul>
                <p>Based on our experience, this definition results in about 10-25 hours of instructional time.</p>
                <h3>What should I include in my Blueprint unit?</h3>
                <p>All Blueprint Units must include the following components to make it easy for teachers to scan, comprehend, and plan on implementing in their classrooms:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Essential Question - what is the big unanswerable thing we are exploring?</li>
                  <li>Unit Student Outcomes - what will students know and be able to do at the end of the unit?</li>
                  <li>Implementation Guidance - practical information on how this can be pulled off successfully.</li>
                  <li>Prerequisites</li>
                  <li>Day-by-Day Planner</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Learning Objectives - what will students be able to do at the end of the day?</li>
                      <li>What will teachers be doing that day?</li>
                      <li>What will students be doing that day?</li>
                      <li>Resources - readings, videos, sample code, worksheets, assessments, etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                  <li>End of Unit Assessment</li>
                      <ul>
                        <li>How can students express what they’ve learned in some creative way?</li>
                        <li>How will teachers evaluate whether students are walking away with a new perspective on CS concepts and practices?</li>
                      </ul>
                </ul>
                <h3>How do I contribute?</h3>
                <p>The Blueprint utilizes a tight integration with Google Docs to make it easy for educators to use a unit. You simply need to provide a link to your Google Doc (make sure that it’s publicly viewable) and the site will fetch the content, maintaining your formatting and styling.</p>
                <p>Once the content is fetched, we ask you to complete some basic information about the unit to make it easy for educators to find your unit.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="sample">
                <div class="col-md-10">
                  <h3>Essential Question</h3>
                    <p> This is a question that leads to meaningful exploration of CS concepts and practices.</p>
                  <h3>Example Computer Science Essential Questions</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li> How can computers help us conduct scientific experiments?</li>
                    <li> How can programming represent your ideas and beliefs?</li>

                    <li> How will computers impact your future?</li>
                    <li> Why are computers essential to your future?</li>
                    <li> How can we share/publish on the Internet?</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h3>Unit Rationale</h3>
                    <p>Narrative of what the unit is about and why we should learn it. Simple enough that a student could read it and get it.</p>
                  <h3>Pacing</h3>
                    <p>The pacing of a unit should be expressed in number of total hours the unit will take in a typical classroom. Please try to take into account transition time at the beginning and end of class periods.</p>
                  <h3>Materials</h3>
                    <p>What hardware, software, or other materials will teachers need for lessons and end-of-unit performance task?</p>
                  <h3>Unit Student Outcomes</h3>
                    <p>What the student should know and be able to do by the end of the unit:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>CS Concepts, Practices and Perspectives</li>
                        <li>Vocabulary</li>
                        <li>Brief Description of Performance Tasks and Formative Assessments</li>
                          <ul>
                              <li>Pre-Assessment</li>
                              <li>End-of-Unit Performance-Based Assessment</li>
                                <ul>
                                  <li>How can students express what they’ve learned in some creative way?</li>
                                  <li>How will teachers evaluate whether students’ CS Perspective has progressed such they may be ready to take a new Perspective in a new unit? See the Foundations section for more on CS Perspectives.</li>
                                </ul>
                          </ul>
                      </ul>
                  <h3>Prerequisites & Pre-Assessment</h3>
                    <p>What do students and teachers need to know or be able to do to be successful? These can be expressed as standards (Common Core, Next Generation Science Standards, etc.), references to standard curriculum or scopes & sequences, or in language that you’ve tested as comprehensible to educators.</p>
                  <h3>Implementation Guidance & Reflection</h3>
                    <p>What happened when you delivered the unit? What modifications might you consider making - why and how?</p>
                  <h3>Day-by-Day Planner</h3>
                    <p>The length of “Days” should be very clearly stated at the beginning of the Day-by-Day Planner. The day-by-day planner need not be a detailed walkthrough of exactly what teachers are doing, but should provide at least the following to give teachers the shape of the day(s).</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Learning Objectives - what will students be able to do at the end of the day?</li>
                        <li>What will teachers be doing that day?</li>
                        <li>What will students be doing that day?</li>
                        <li>Resources - readings, videos, sample code, worksheets, assessments, etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Lesson objectives may take multiple days to complete as long as they are clearly delineated as such. Please do not use other names for days, such as classes, sessions, or periods, because schools use those words in different ways.</p>

                    <h3>End-of-Unit Performance-Based Assessment</h3>
                    <p>The performance task should be described with enough detail that the teacher understands:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Pacing: oftentimes CS projects take more than one day, teachers will need an idea of how to break up the project so they can plan and keep students on track</li>
                        <li>Multiple Project Exit Points: an idea of high-medium-low projects so students are locked into one end product. The end product of CS performance task is not as important to the assessment as is the analysis and communication displayed in presentation and reflection activities</li>
                        <li>Presentation: how will students share their work? will they share with peers, outside world? what media could/should be made available to students? <strong>Include a Rubric</strong></li>
                        <li>Reflection: reflection questions that ask students to think about CS concepts and practices. <strong>Include a Rubric</strong></li>
                      </ul>
