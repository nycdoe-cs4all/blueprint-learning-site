    <p>Creative computing is a 54-hour long introductory project-based computer science (CS) course that leads students to explore fundamental CS concepts and practices through using <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>, a block-based programming language. Throughout the course students will practice to think like the way computers process and learn how to communicate with it. As students create projects with Scratch programming, they will learn how to collaborate with their peers, present and share their work to/with others, and contribute to the larger CS community. This curriculum aligns with the <a href="https://blueprint.cs4all.nyc">CS4All Blueprint</a> for CS education that emphasizes a hands-on approach called creative computing.</p>
