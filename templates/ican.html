  <p>The tool below helps us explore &quot;I can&quot; statements that provide the vocabulary and a frame of reference for how our students will engage with CS content. </p>
  <p>The rigorous instructional material should include a mixture of tasks from across Webb's Depth of Knowledge (DOK) levels. </p>
