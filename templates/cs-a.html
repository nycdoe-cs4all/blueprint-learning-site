      <p>NYCDOE will prepare teachers to deliver the TEALS program AP CS-A curriculum. To help teachers build a strong base in Java, the object-oriented language used in CS-A, DOE is collaborating with Oracle Academy to provide educator professional development via the Oracle Academy training programs. These courses are focused in Java and AP CS A teachers are encouraged to register and attend as a means of supporting Java content knowledge. This training is available to teachers with previous experience in CS.
