    <p>Creating From Scratch builds off of the prior Computer Science knowledge that students may possess about concepts. In the first part of the unit, students will be re-introduced to the concepts of hardware/software and input/output. Students will create a Scratch account and begin to explore the platform. In order for students to strengthen their problem solving skills, they will work through the concepts of: algorithms, programming, debugging, loops, conditionals, and abstraction. For each concept, students will receive instruction first through an “unplugged” activity. Then, students will apply their knowledge of the concept to a “plugged” activity via Scratch. Towards the end of the unit, students will be tasked with reverse engineering a Scratch project. Students plan on recreating/reverse engineering the Scratch project seen in a previous lesson. The unit culminates with a final project Hackathon or Codeathon performed over the course of multiple days.</p>
