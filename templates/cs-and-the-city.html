    <p>CS and the City is a full-year capstone course during which students will engage with civic issues in their communities by building a computational artifact with <a href="https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/data/">New York City Open Data</a>. Students will explore and engage with the NYC Open Data portal and the agencies that provide data, utilize data to better understand civic issues in their communities, and build interactive, industry-standard websites using open datasets. </p>

    <p>All students should understand how computer science concepts and practices impact their lives, their friends’ lives, and their families’ lives. NYC Open Data all government open data, can help provide that perspective because it is created by their communities or is directly linked to things in their communities - like trees, parks, schools, businesses. This curriculum aligns with the <a href="https://blueprint.cs4all.nyc">CS4All Blueprint</a> for CS education that emphasizes a hands-on approach called creative computing. Lessons and teacher materials will be available in Summer 2019.
