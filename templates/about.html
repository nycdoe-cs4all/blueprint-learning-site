      <p>The Computer Science for All (CS4All) Blueprint is an academic and implementation guide for teaching computer science in New York City public schools. We know that it's a big undertaking to support educators and their school communities as they begin to integrate computer science into their classrooms. We created the Blueprint with a dedicated group of <a href="#fellows">Blueprint Teacher Fellows</a>, building on their understanding of CS education, and their experience in NYC classrooms.</p>

      <p>We gathered feedback from more than 30 sessions with researchers, members of the CS education community, industry experts, and families. We incorporated their needs, values, and goals in our design, direction, and content. </p>
      <p>A list of these stakeholders, as well as the important ideas and feedback they offered, are summarized below.</p>

      <p>With this beta (first published draft) version of the Blueprint, the CS4All team is engaging a new cohort of Teacher Fellows, and working with administrators to further refine and develop the resources schools need to implement a rigorous computer science curriculum.</p>

                <p> The Blueprint Fellowship for the 2017-18 school year is structured with two tracks; Curriculum, and Pedagogy. We have almost 50 teachers participating this year!</p>

                <p>The Curriculum Fellows, who got started in early July 2017, are designing Blueprint-aligned CS units to test in the classroom and eventually publish on the Blueprint.</p>

                <p>The Pedagogy Fellows will be meeting in August to kick-off a year of intervisitation and peer observation that will be published as video <a href="/resources">resources</a> on the Blueprint.</p>
