      <p>The Computer Science for All (CS4All) Blueprint is an academic and implementation guide for teaching computer science in New York City public schools. We know that it's a big undertaking to support educators and their school communities as they begin to integrate, many for the first time, computer science into their classrooms. So we created the Blueprint with a dedicated group of <a href="#fellows">Blueprint Teacher Fellows</a>, elevating their CS teaching knowledge and experience in NYC classrooms.</p>

      <p>We also gathered feedback from more than 30  sessions with researchers, the CS education community, industry, and families; and incorporated their needs, values, and goals in our design direction and content. </p>
      <p>A list of these stakeholders, as well as the important ideas and feedback they offered, are summarized below.</p> 

      <p>With this beta (first published draft) version of the Blueprint, the CS4All team is engaging a new cohort of Teacher Fellows, and work with administrators to further refine and develop the resources schools need to implement a rigorous computer science curriculum.</p>
