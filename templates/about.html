    <p>The Computer Science for All (CS4All) Blueprint is an academic and implementation guide for teaching computer science in New York City public schools.</p>

<div id="about-blueprint" class="article-content">

      <img src="http://cs4all.nyc/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CS4All_launch-workhop1_p11.jpg">
      <p>We know that it's a big undertaking to support educators and their school communities as they begin to integrate computer science into their classrooms. We created the Blueprint with a dedicated group of <a href="#fellows">Blueprint Teacher Fellows</a>, building on their understanding of CS education, and their experience in NYC classrooms.</p>

<div id="about-blueprint-more" class="collapse">
      <p>We gathered feedback from more than 30 sessions with researchers, members of the CS education community, industry experts, and families. We incorporated their needs, values, and goals in our design, direction, and content. </p>
      <p>A list of these stakeholders, as well as the important ideas and feedback they offered, are summarized below.</p>

      <p>With this beta (first published draft) version of the Blueprint, the CS4All team is engaging a new cohort of Teacher Fellows, and working with administrators to further refine and develop the resources schools need to implement a rigorous computer science curriculum.</p>

					<h4><span>A message from the fellows:</span> What are we trying to teach?</h4>

					<p>In Math class, students hold a pencil. They may hold that same pencil in English, but what they’re asked to produce, how they’re trained to think and question –  look different. In neither class is the pencil the focus.</p>

					<p>In computer science, the computer is the pencil.</p>

					<div id="about-fellows-more" class="collapse">
						<p>Your students have used computers to convey their thinking -- to get it on a document, on a slide, in a picture, or on a piece of paper. Our hope is that these resources will help you create a classroom in which students think with the computer, where the
						computer becomes &quot;a bicycle for the mind,&quot; a tool for empowering and unlocking our students' curiosity and creativity.</p>

						<p>We'll be tackling everything from recommended programming languages and courses of study, to the arrangement of tables and chairs in your classroom. There is a lot to digest (and a lot that we are still learning,) but these resources were put together
						by folks who love teaching computer science and learned to teach it, just like you, while in the classroom.</p>

						<p>A final thought before we jump into the nitty-gritty. Why CS4All? After all, not everyone will become a computer programmer, and that is totally fine. Not every student will become a novelist, but every student has the right to read great literature,
						to be exposed to the possibility that she can create something great and enduring. CS4All is about unlocking potential.  Our objective is not to produce coders, but young people who think about code and are not afraid to try to read and write it. </p>
						<p>In
						the history of computer science, we have mostly been content to wait for prodigies to drive innovation. We believe there is more prodigious talent in our students that can be unlocked by learning to create and iterate. These resources are a commitment
						to equity, to unlocking more unrealized potential in all our students, in as many ways as we possibly can.</p>

					<h4>2017-2018 Fellows</h4>
					<p> The Blueprint Fellowship for the 2017-18 school year is structured as two tracks - Curriculum and Pedagogy. We have almost 50 teachers participating this year!</p>

					<p>The Curriculum Fellows, who got started in early July 2017, are designed Blueprint-aligned CS units to test in the classroom and eventually publish on the Blueprint. The Pedagogy Fellows will meeting in August to kick-off a year of interivistation and peer observation that will published as video <a href="/resources">resources</a> on the Blueprint.</p>

					<p> Names and bios will be posted soon!</p>
