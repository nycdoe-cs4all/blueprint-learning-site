<h1>Computer Science Practices</h1>
<p class="c1">In the sections below, we define CS practices commonly used by individuals studying and applying computing. CS Practices provide structure for activities that students engage in.</p>
<p class="c1 c23"></p>
<p class="c1">Each practice is intertwined with the others and will require time for students to apply concepts, analyze information from multiple sources, as well as design and create artifacts.</p>

  <li><a href="#prototype">Prototype: Projects connected to their interests</a></li>
  <li><a href="#communicate">Communicate: Their understanding of computing concepts</a></li>
</ul>
<p class="c1">Educators must mold the practices to fit the needs of their students. This could mean that only components of a specific practice are covered.</p><p class="c1 c23"></p>

<a name="analyze"></a><h2>Analyze (AN): The impact of computing</h2>
<p class="c1">People of all backgrounds must evaluate and respond to the ways that computing affects their lives, their families and friends, as well as their communities. Government, industry, startups, nonprofits, researchers, artists and many others use the principles of computing to accomplish an increasing number of tasks. Some of these tasks we may think of as beneficial or malicious, and we are still not sure of how to evaluate others.</p>

  <a name="prototype"></a><h2>Prototype (PR): Computing projects connected to student interests</h2>
  <p class="c1">The goal of the prototyping practice is to help students build a mental model of how to use a computer to create new applications. Computer applications or programs like word processors or web browsers define how we use computers in a limited way. When we practice prototyping computing projects, we are creating our own applications; using computers in different ways than when we fire up our word processor or web browser.</p>
  <p class="c1">There are many versions of the prototyping process - this is a seven step process that equally weighs:</p><p class="c1">&#9679;     Researching and designing what to build (many connections to the <a class="c27" href="#analyze">analyze</a> practice).</p>
  <p class="c1">&#9679;     Building the prototype in iterations, or many small parts, in order to test often and make small changes.</p>
