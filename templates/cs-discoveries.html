    <p>Computer Science Discoveries is an introductory computer science course that empowers students to create authentic artifacts and engage with computer science as a medium for creativity, communication, problem-solving, and fun. With a combination of unplugged activities to engage students in logic and introduce basic concepts, students also use a number of digital tools to create projects like websites, games, and apps that include a physical computing component with Adafruitâ€™s Circuit Playground. The course features six units which can be done in a single semester or a full year, and resources can be found online to allow flexibility of in-class meeting time. The course is young, but a strong community of over 500 teachers across the United States participate in forums to help modify the course for a variety of diverse student populations. <a href="https://vimeo.com/251538125">Watch this video</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gx99bJIbUr6a43olU_pEBt_M4xkXB4VXv2SL5SPtqj4/edit?usp=sharing">view this fact sheet</a> for more information.</p>
