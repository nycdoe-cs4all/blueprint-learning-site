♪

00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:12.212
So, today,
we're at the Intrepid

00:00:12.278 --> 00:00:13.380
for CS4All's launch

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:15.248
of Computer Science
Education Week.

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:17.417
So, CS Ed Week
is all about exposure

00:00:17.484 --> 00:00:19.352
to computer science
for students.

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:21.788
Introducing kids to
computer science is important

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:24.924
because we want to teach kids
to be the creators

00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:26.493
of the technology
that they consume

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:27.794
on a regular basis.

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:30.196
We want to make sure that
all students are doing CS,

00:00:30.263 --> 00:00:32.699
so CS Ed Week is all about
teachers being able

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:35.502
to give students opportunities
to see what CS is.

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:38.338
So, how can we move beyond
just playing games,

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:40.407
watching videos, using apps?

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:43.343
How can we get going to the--
into this notion of

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.411
participating in that?

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:45.979
Teachers are super excited.

00:00:46.045 --> 00:00:47.647
I think the Intrepid
is helping out,

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:49.382
but just the fact
that they're going to get

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:52.152
real support
in this beautiful setting,

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:54.554
I think they're stoked
and ready to go.

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:56.156
Well, I'm excited
about everything.

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:58.758
I want to see what's
the latest technology

00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:00.527
available for the classroom,

00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:02.929
how I can introduce it
to my students

00:01:02.996 --> 00:01:04.297
and make it fun.

00:01:04.364 --> 00:01:06.099
One of the most important
things to build with students

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:07.700
is the notion of fearlessness.

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:10.770
It's exciting for them
because it gives them

00:01:10.837 --> 00:01:14.240
an opportunity to showcase
their knowledge

00:01:14.307 --> 00:01:17.076
and understanding of
what's happening with them.

00:01:17.143 --> 00:01:19.412
Actually, I am learning
from my students.

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.548
They tend to get it faster
than I do.

00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:23.817
That's really easier, right?

00:01:23.883 --> 00:01:28.021
♪

00:01:28.087 --> 00:01:29.389
Let's get coding.

00:01:29.456 --> 00:01:31.124
One of the first things
we're gonna do

00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:34.394
is we're gonna talk about
unplugged versus online.

00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:35.628
So, we're trying
to introduce teachers

00:01:35.695 --> 00:01:37.530
to computer science concepts,

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:39.132
so the foundations
that they would need

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:42.669
to move into any field
of computer science.

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:45.605
It's an opportunity for us
to learn from each other.

00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:47.774
Just like when you give
directions to your students,

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:51.311
you have to be very precise
when you give them directions,

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:53.947
same thing when you're giving
directions to a computer.

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:56.316
We have to be very precise
when we're doing this.

00:01:56.382 --> 00:01:58.451
So, we learned a lot about,
like, just different things

00:01:58.518 --> 00:02:00.253
to make it engaging in class.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.089
Before I came here,
I had a really hard time

00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:04.757
implementing computer science
in my class

00:02:04.824 --> 00:02:06.326
because the kids are so young,

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:08.127
but now that I came here,
it's just--

00:02:08.194 --> 00:02:10.196
I found so many videos,
so many resources

00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:11.965
I can take back
to my classroom

00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:13.299
and use it with my children.

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:14.300
So, how hard was this?

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:15.668
Do you think your kids
can do it?

00:02:15.735 --> 00:02:17.270
So then teachers take this

00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:19.339
and put on an event
in their school.

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:21.441
We're hoping for something
that's more like a pep rally

00:02:21.508 --> 00:02:24.177
to get kids excited
about computer science.

00:02:24.244 --> 00:02:25.111
This is our hackathon.

00:02:25.178 --> 00:02:26.346
We do one every year.

00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:27.714
This is our second annual one

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.716
where the kids get
to design a game.

00:02:29.782 --> 00:02:31.217
It's part of
the Computer Science Week.

00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:34.087
Well, our game is
kind of like a maze

00:02:34.153 --> 00:02:35.588
that a mouse has to get around

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:37.657
and it's, like,
trying to escape the cat.

00:02:37.724 --> 00:02:39.926
So, like, the cat
is technically "the bully"

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:41.160
in the situation,

00:02:41.227 --> 00:02:42.629
so it kind of relates
to school.

00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:44.063
Even if they don't
become programmers

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.431
or software engineers,

00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:47.367
they'll have more appreciation
of what goes into it.

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:48.668
Sometimes, like, if I mess up,

00:02:48.735 --> 00:02:50.303
I'll just start
a whole new one again.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.739
So, I'd start it over
and then I get it.

00:02:52.805 --> 00:02:54.541
This is gonna be an event
forever, you know?

00:02:54.607 --> 00:02:56.409
It's our second one,
it's bigger and better.

00:02:56.476 --> 00:02:57.644
I'm gonna have to top this
somehow next year.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.246
I'm not sure how.

00:03:00.313 --> 00:03:03.983
♪

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.653
I believe computer science
helps students become

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:08.087
innovative thinkers.

00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:11.124
It gives them an opportunity
to problem-solve.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.459
We have many problems that are
going to be approaching us

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:15.929
in this 21st century,
and unless we have

00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:18.665
a diverse group
of future young people

00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:21.000
thinking about
how to solve those problems,

00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:22.435
they will not be solved.

00:03:22.502 --> 00:03:26.139
Our purpose of doing this
is to provide

00:03:26.205 --> 00:03:28.508
productive citizens
in our society.

00:03:28.575 --> 00:03:31.077
I'm interested
in moving forward

00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:34.047
into the future with my class.
