00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.169
Come on over, lean in,
and what's theoretically wrong

00:00:03.236 --> 00:00:05.071
with this piece of embroidery?

00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:07.474
My background is as
a working artist.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.809
The designer wanted this
to all be even.

00:00:09.876 --> 00:00:11.411
I think human beings
like making things,

00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:13.480
and touching things,
and looking at things.

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:15.715
Can we find what the problem is
and fix it?

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:17.484
Yes, by looking at the code.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.519
So, by making code visible,

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:23.456
by using code
like an art material,

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:26.059
we can touch it
and get to know it.

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:28.128
When you touch it
and you feel it, you can see

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:30.630
that it looks like four
but there really are six.

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:32.799
It makes it very personal,
and all of a sudden,

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:36.002
the pattern-making becomes
a personal expression,

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:38.405
which is really what
coding should be.

00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:40.039
Interesting design, right?

00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:44.310
♪

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:46.312
So, we're using Turtlestitch,

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.548
which is a relative of Snap.

00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:50.116
It's the same base code,

00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:54.554
and we're building
coding problems

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:58.158
and then we're stitching them
to see them.

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:00.560
-The code is the pattern.
-Yeah, exactly.

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:02.162
So, I'm gonna model one for you

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:03.997
and then I have set up
three problems,

00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:05.665
challenges around the room
for you.

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:08.034
So, I presented three
different challenges.

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:09.335
Analyze the problem.

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:12.305
To look at,
to identify the problem,

00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:15.241
to analyze the problem first
so they could recognize

00:01:15.308 --> 00:01:17.710
what problem
they thought existed.

00:01:17.777 --> 00:01:19.979
And then they started to think
about strategies

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:22.382
for dealing with the problem
or debugging it.

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:24.517
So, write some Post-its,
stick them here,

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:26.786
and then what could be done
to fix or debug it.

00:01:26.853 --> 00:01:30.190
So, you give people code
and say, "Debug the problem,"

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:32.792
which we've done,
but giving them a real pattern

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:34.727
and realizing you wanna make
a different pattern,

00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:37.397
it changes debugging,
yet it's the same strategies.

00:01:37.464 --> 00:01:40.266
And so, if you can learn
to debug code

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:42.569
by making something
and by touching it,

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:44.938
if it engages you
and debugging is no longer

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:46.639
an exercise you have to do
every night,

00:01:46.706 --> 00:01:49.943
but it's really a process
that becomes fun.

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.744
It is fun,
because you're connecting

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:54.147
between computers
and then making it real.

00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:57.150
So, you can look at the math
and science behind it

00:01:57.217 --> 00:01:59.786
and see what goes into
making something like this.

00:01:59.853 --> 00:02:02.255
I think having something
in your hand

00:02:02.322 --> 00:02:04.724
that you can actually hold,
look at

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:08.928
really brings a new element
to actually doing it,

00:02:08.995 --> 00:02:12.465
because yeah, I can visualize
the code in my head.

00:02:12.532 --> 00:02:14.934
Being able to actually have
something in my hand.

00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:16.402
Like, the problems we did today,

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:18.338
you wouldn't really be able
to see where it's thicker,

00:02:18.404 --> 00:02:19.772
'cause it just goes over it.

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:21.608
But here you--but with it
actually in your hand,

00:02:21.674 --> 00:02:23.343
you can determine like,

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.445
"Well, that's not exactly
what I wanted."

00:02:25.512 --> 00:02:28.248
So, it helps in that sense,

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:30.416
and it makes you feel
I guess more engaged.

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:31.718
Like, you made this yourself.

00:02:31.784 --> 00:02:34.721
This is yours, you know.

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:36.389
So we might have to change.

00:02:36.456 --> 00:02:37.690
And this one's
like a combination.

00:02:37.757 --> 00:02:41.261
I enjoy the concept
of hands-on debugging,

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:43.496
and actually taking it
off the computer

00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:44.797
and letting the kids see that,
you know,

00:02:44.864 --> 00:02:46.566
they kinda do this all the time
when you're looking at

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:48.434
different things
in you're regular life,

00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:51.271
and then by debugging it
on the computer,

00:02:51.337 --> 00:02:52.605
it's really the same thing.

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:55.308
Using process of elimination,
seeing what's wrong,

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:58.378
identifying the problem,
and then solving the problem.

00:02:58.444 --> 00:03:01.548
I think it's human nature to
enjoy troubleshooting a problem,

00:03:01.614 --> 00:03:03.650
especially a design problem.

00:03:03.716 --> 00:03:06.252
So, it is engaging,
it's really fun,

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.755
which is really what
coding should be.

00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:09.989
You don't learn to code.

00:03:10.056 --> 00:03:11.991
You code to express yourself,

00:03:12.058 --> 00:03:15.428
and code can be and is
in our day and age,

00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:19.599
an artist's material
as much as clay in many ways.

00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:23.136
To me, I find that
it's a very interesting

00:03:23.202 --> 00:03:25.238
almost interconnection

00:03:25.305 --> 00:03:28.041
of art and coding.

00:03:28.107 --> 00:03:30.243
And what's most fascinating
about it is that

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.513
through the usage of art,
it almost enables you

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.782
to like touch your code.

00:03:35.848 --> 00:03:39.419
It enables you to physically see

00:03:39.485 --> 00:03:41.487
your code coming to life.

00:03:41.554 --> 00:03:43.656
I learned about Turtlestitch

00:03:43.723 --> 00:03:46.025
when I went to a Scratch
conference in Amsterdam,

00:03:46.092 --> 00:03:47.527
and I fell in love
with Turtlestitch.

00:03:47.594 --> 00:03:50.063
I came back and I wasn't sure
what I needed to do,

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.098
but I knew the students here
would love it.

00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:54.233
I introduced to my Tech Club
at first,

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.768
and Jennifer
and a few other people

00:03:55.835 --> 00:03:57.971
dabbled in it and were curious.

00:03:58.037 --> 00:04:01.307
Turtlestitch helped me feel
more comfortable with coding,

00:04:01.374 --> 00:04:03.276
because I was a beginner
with it.

00:04:03.343 --> 00:04:04.544
She started learning.

00:04:04.611 --> 00:04:07.280
Just like a sponge,
she soaked everything up.

00:04:07.347 --> 00:04:10.049
And every time she'd try
something and she'd stitch it,

00:04:10.116 --> 00:04:11.818
and then she'd be
so excited about it.

00:04:11.884 --> 00:04:15.054
So, these are comments I made
on each blog.

00:04:15.121 --> 00:04:16.923
So, Jennifer started a blog.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:20.193
I started a blog just to share
my experience

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:23.363
with learning codes.

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:26.733
And I wanted other people
to join me through my journey.

00:04:26.799 --> 00:04:29.135
And then, out of that
came the tutorial cards.

00:04:29.202 --> 00:04:31.270
So, these are Turtlestitch cards
I made.

00:04:31.337 --> 00:04:34.007
Because we realized Turtlestitch
is still pretty new,

00:04:34.073 --> 00:04:35.408
although it's really exploding

00:04:35.475 --> 00:04:37.276
'cause people are so excited
about it.

00:04:37.343 --> 00:04:39.712
Every time she learned something
she made a card for it.

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:43.383
Because I felt the need for
other people to learn as well.

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:47.253
It was really empowering for her
to learn to code,

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.023
and all of a sudden,
math became very purposeful.

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:52.392
She wasn't just studying
for tests anymore.

00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:54.127
She was really learning
and sharing it,

00:04:54.193 --> 00:04:55.795
and part of a community.

00:04:55.862 --> 00:04:57.530
So, it's pretty exciting

00:04:57.597 --> 00:04:59.132
that she's been able
to have that impact.

00:04:59.198 --> 00:05:02.268
STEM courses and courses like
AP Computer Science Principles

00:05:02.335 --> 00:05:05.738
give kids access
to certain opportunities

00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:09.175
that they may not have
in a regular course.

00:05:09.242 --> 00:05:11.577
They can really delve
into coding

00:05:11.644 --> 00:05:14.714
or into combining coding
with art

00:05:14.781 --> 00:05:17.383
or math or science in a way

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.286
that they don't normally have
that opportunity to.

00:05:20.353 --> 00:05:21.921
Now, go back to your solution.

00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:24.390
The only reason I'm teaching
computer science now

00:05:24.457 --> 00:05:28.428
is because I've found a way
to do computer science

00:05:28.494 --> 00:05:30.730
in a way that I do think
it's really powerful,

00:05:30.797 --> 00:05:34.300
but allows me to express myself
as an artist,

00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:37.503
as a teacher, and really
even better than that,

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.006
allows me to pass that on
to my students,

00:05:40.073 --> 00:05:41.974
which is just so wonderful.

00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:43.476
Yes, yes, yes.
