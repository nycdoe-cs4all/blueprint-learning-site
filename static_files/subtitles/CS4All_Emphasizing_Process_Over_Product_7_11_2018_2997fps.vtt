00:00:00.233 --> 00:00:02.235
If you think you can figure
out how to code a block

00:00:02.302 --> 00:00:04.003
that's not there, good.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.939
How would you store
that information?

00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:09.008
The most common thing to use
in this kind of form of binary.

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:10.477
One of the things
that we set up

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:11.811
and tell them
from the very beginning

00:00:11.878 --> 00:00:14.547
is that in computer science

00:00:14.614 --> 00:00:17.016
there is no one way
to do anything.

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:18.418
We didn't want them to raise
their hand and say,

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:20.320
"Well, what block
do I put here?"

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:24.591
So, we tried to think about
what strategies we could use

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:26.359
and what we could give them

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:27.927
that they could use
independently.

00:00:27.994 --> 00:00:29.662
Okay, so then
this will likely be

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:32.432
what you put in that report,
this exact variable.

Yesterday in class,
we introduced them

00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:42.041
to what the goal was

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:43.376
and we had them
break that down

00:00:43.443 --> 00:00:46.379
into large high level of tasks.

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:49.549
-The X value and the Y value.
-Yeah.

00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:53.653
Today's Do Now asks them
to review those tasks,

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.755
see where they thought
issues might come up,

00:00:55.822 --> 00:00:57.791
what things they thought
might be challenging.

00:00:57.857 --> 00:01:00.994
When you're coding something,
it's endless.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.463
You can go up the straight path

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.432
or you can go down
the rocky mountains

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:08.101
and you'll still end up
in the same place,

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:09.602
but you first
have to write it out

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:12.972
in how you would do it
and make it your own.

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:15.275
It's very easy for the students
to get bogged down

00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:17.177
in the minor details
of the code

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:19.279
and not think about
the big picture,

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:22.148
so we ask them to get
an outline on paper first,

00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:25.251
then we ask them to play
around with the code.

00:01:25.318 --> 00:01:26.319
-Okay?
-Okay.

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:28.588
We work on our code
or try to solve,

00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:31.624
like, a certain problem,
then we'll share to the class

00:01:31.691 --> 00:01:33.693
and everyone will,
like, describe

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.496
what problems they faced
or--and how they solved it.

00:01:36.563 --> 00:01:39.132
If the number is, like,
divisible by four

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:42.068
and make the third zero
in the sequence one.

00:01:42.135 --> 00:01:45.004
And the share out
actually saw us step through

00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:46.506
the one that
they had discussed

00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:48.174
so that everyone
came away with

00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:50.510
at least this one algorithm
that they had a sense

00:01:50.577 --> 00:01:51.711
of how to complete.

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:55.648
We need to, like, subtract it
from that number

00:01:55.715 --> 00:01:59.219
because, like,
64 will obviously

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:02.522
fit in a number
that 128 fits in.

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:03.957
You're absolutely right.

00:02:04.023 --> 00:02:07.360
I think a lot of education
focuses on

00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:10.763
the product
and not necessarily the process

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.798

00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:14.200

is useful

breaking the code
into sections,

"What do I do,"
