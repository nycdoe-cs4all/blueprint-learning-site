WEBVTT

00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:03.336
Welcome, everybody, and let's
have a round of applause.

00:00:03.403 --> 00:00:07.040
You guys are going to create
a website

00:00:07.107 --> 00:00:09.576
for real life customers.

00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:12.612
When they say
Computer Science For All,

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.014
it really means for all,

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:18.284
and my students,
they find things

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:20.787
that I could never even imagine,

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:22.655
first of all, was online.

00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:25.625
So they're already really good
at using it.

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:26.726
There you go!

00:00:26.793 --> 00:00:28.495
So, I felt it was important

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:31.131
to teach them
how to create on it.

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:34.401
They don't have to passively
use technology.

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:36.069
They can be innovators.

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:37.537
They have a lot to offer.

00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:39.139
I have an idea.

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:42.108
♪

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:45.211
We were doing a Hackathon
for our school.

00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:46.946
My name's Jonathan.

00:00:47.013 --> 00:00:49.949
Today we'll be working on
3D websites.

00:00:50.016 --> 00:00:51.151
I was the host.

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:53.753
-My name is Rebecca.
-Hi, Rebecca!

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.190
The host makes sure
everyone else is doing good,

00:00:57.257 --> 00:00:59.325
or make sure everyone's safe.

00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:03.630
Jonathan Hannan is a high school
student with autism.

00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:07.033
When he came here, he was
very shy and very reserved,

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.502
and pretty much
kept to himself a lot.

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:13.373
But through computer science
where he excels,

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.977
it's really been
confidence building for him.

00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:19.979
He's a wonderful student,

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:22.182
and he's basically
my assistant teacher,

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:24.751
because he takes what
I introduce, runs with it,

00:01:24.818 --> 00:01:26.519
and then helps the rest
of his classmates.

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:28.555
So, he's amazing.

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:31.124
Having a blog is also
a cheap and effective way

00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:32.926
for people to show their work
on the internet.

00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:35.361
So, you know, the software
engineering program,

00:01:35.428 --> 00:01:37.030
computer science in general,

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:39.299
it really helps the kids grow

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:41.367
in ways that's more
than academic.

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:43.069
It's helping them grow socially.

00:01:43.136 --> 00:01:45.605
Some people blog about
a special interest or a hobby.

00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:48.241
We have also invited
New Dorp High School

00:01:48.308 --> 00:01:49.776
to share in our Hackathon

00:01:49.843 --> 00:01:51.377
here at the Great Kills
High School.

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:53.146
I wanna give you a trick
so it won't be.

00:01:53.213 --> 00:01:55.548
My daughter's a software
engineering student

00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:56.983
at New Dorp High School,

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.487
and she has been my sidekick
for many years

00:02:00.553 --> 00:02:02.188
when it comes to
a multitude of things

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:03.756
that I've done
with students with autism.

00:02:03.823 --> 00:02:05.425
And I always wanted
to present them

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:07.427
with integrated opportunities.

00:02:07.494 --> 00:02:10.363
-So, that was just a no-brainer.
-Thank you.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.664
There's no place
that they're gonna go

00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:14.033
where there's only gonna be
people with autism.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.137
Today in our Hackathon,
we started discussing websites.

00:02:18.204 --> 00:02:20.240
We watched a BrainPOP movie
that discussed

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:22.375
a particular type of website
called a blog.

00:02:22.442 --> 00:02:25.178
A photo blog is a blog
that features photographs.

00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:28.381
We observed what makes
a good website.

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:30.617
The colors are soft.

00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:32.452
And what makes a bad website.

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:33.653
Nothing is working.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.788
And we discussed design layout.

00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:37.757
They used the full screen.

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:40.126
And then we started building.

00:02:40.193 --> 00:02:41.761
We had to do a couple things.

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:43.663
One of them is figure out

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.199
what your website's name
is gonna be.

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:48.801
Then after that,
what pictures that you want.

00:02:48.868 --> 00:02:52.639
After that it's your text,
and so on and so on.

00:02:52.705 --> 00:02:55.675
And you're going to take
pictures for the website.

00:02:55.742 --> 00:02:57.677
♪

00:02:57.744 --> 00:03:00.246
Excellent.

00:03:00.313 --> 00:03:01.814
Look at me.

00:03:01.881 --> 00:03:04.150
(indistinct remarks)

00:03:04.217 --> 00:03:06.786
The students went to
the cluster locations

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:08.788
and took their own photographs

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:11.558
to come back then and upload
into the website.

00:03:11.624 --> 00:03:12.959
Do you know how to upload it?

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:15.028
The students built websites

00:03:15.094 --> 00:03:17.630
for our adapted phys ed program.

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:19.732
They built it for
our Snap Shots program

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.734
which is a program here
at the Great Kills High School

00:03:21.801 --> 00:03:23.469
where they're learning
photography.

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:25.071
It's photography time!

00:03:25.138 --> 00:03:26.339
And green screening,

00:03:26.406 --> 00:03:28.474
and things in the visual
communication field.

00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:30.944
They also use Wolf Pack Designs,

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.714
and they make assistive devices
for students with disabilities.

00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:37.717
And these things are used
by students

00:03:37.784 --> 00:03:40.286
all over New York City,
not just Staten Island.

00:03:40.353 --> 00:03:42.488
They love when you teach them

00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:45.258
how to build things
using technology.

00:03:45.325 --> 00:03:47.026
The part that I enjoyed the most

00:03:47.093 --> 00:03:49.996
was creating the actual website,

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:51.998
because that was like
the main aspect,

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:54.367
and it's an extremely
interesting field

00:03:54.434 --> 00:03:56.069
with all the stuff
you can do with it.

00:03:56.135 --> 00:03:58.404
It wouldn't be a Hackathon
if we're just taking pictures.

00:03:58.471 --> 00:04:00.373
I thought the Hackathon

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.309
was absolutely fantastic.

00:04:03.376 --> 00:04:06.546
The engagement of the students,

00:04:06.613 --> 00:04:10.249
the engagement of the adults
who were present.

00:04:10.316 --> 00:04:12.952
Everyone was learning,

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.221
and everyone took something

00:04:15.288 --> 00:04:18.725
from that particular experience.

00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:21.661
I think autistic kids
should really learn

00:04:21.728 --> 00:04:23.162
how to do technology.

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:24.597
You know what, get rid
of this first, click on this.

00:04:24.664 --> 00:04:26.432
And if they don't,

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:29.402
they may lose out
on big opportunities.

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:33.573
We're gonna showcase
what you guys created today.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.576
Not much kids are
in charge with technology.

00:04:36.643 --> 00:04:38.444
They don't even know, like,

00:04:38.511 --> 00:04:39.946
when you go home
and you play games,

00:04:40.013 --> 00:04:41.247
you don't give it
a second thought,

00:04:41.314 --> 00:04:43.149
but that's a field
of computer science

00:04:43.216 --> 00:04:44.751
right there
that you can get into.

00:04:44.817 --> 00:04:47.320
That you can also use
for iPads as well.

00:04:47.387 --> 00:04:49.022
'Cause you can do anything
you want with it

00:04:49.088 --> 00:04:51.257
if you put your mind to it
in computer science.

00:04:51.324 --> 00:04:54.093
So, you know,
they have a lot to offer.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.995
I want them to show the world,

00:04:56.062 --> 00:04:58.698
and I want them to show the
world through computer science.

00:04:58.765 --> 00:05:01.200
Nice!

00:05:01.267 --> 00:05:03.069
I would say,

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:05.972
specifically in the field
of computer science,

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:07.807
don't be afraid
to try something new.

00:05:07.874 --> 00:05:09.976
Differentiate instruction.

00:05:10.043 --> 00:05:12.645
Break it down
so no matter how the student

00:05:12.712 --> 00:05:14.347
can show they're learning.

00:05:14.414 --> 00:05:16.616
They can show through
what they've created.

00:05:16.683 --> 00:05:19.085
They can show it
by verbally talking about it

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:21.187
or by their artistic endeavors.

00:05:21.254 --> 00:05:23.389
Allow your students
to express their learning

00:05:23.456 --> 00:05:25.958
in the way that's best suited
for them.

00:05:26.025 --> 00:05:28.394
And you can do that very easily
through computer science.

00:05:28.461 --> 00:05:31.397
(cheering)
