00:00:01.835 --> 00:00:03.770
Let's walk you through this,
what do you want it to do?

00:00:03.837 --> 00:00:05.205
And then I added this.

00:00:05.271 --> 00:00:06.506
When I'm getting my class
started, I'm trying

00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:09.309
to get everybody
pretty much on the same page.

00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:10.977
Think about
the logical possibility.

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:13.713
In this area of the curriculum
right now,

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.348
everyone's doing
something separate.

00:00:15.415 --> 00:00:16.516
I wanna make sure
that they're all

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:18.284
working towards a common goal.

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:19.953
So, we're building games.

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:23.390
I'm trying to get kids really
focused on where they are now,

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:24.791
and where they should be
at the end of class,

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:26.559
and where they should be
thinking for the future.

00:00:26.626 --> 00:00:28.695
In the next unit we do,
you'll learn about cloning

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:29.996
and then your mind will explode.

00:00:30.063 --> 00:00:32.966
We need to be thinking about
how your two ideas

00:00:33.032 --> 00:00:35.301
are going to make
one cohesive game.

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:38.938
♪

00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:41.274
Today, you're focused
on getting your game

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:43.610
to beta one stage.

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:45.211
We're doing a pool game.

00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:47.280
In this particular project,
they're working with partners.

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:50.583
Generally, I do pair students up
even when we're doing labs

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.952
so they have someone to bounce
ideas off of,

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:54.421
and so that
they can work in pairs

00:00:54.487 --> 00:00:56.022
and kinda learn
from each other as well.

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:57.757
Instead of us just
like one-on-one,

00:00:57.824 --> 00:00:59.125
just trying to come up
with things,

00:00:59.192 --> 00:01:00.660
we can hear from
each other's feedback

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:02.762
and we can actually move
a lot faster

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:05.064
than what we would
normally do by ourselves.

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:07.967
Every time we do group projects,
I assign the groups,

00:01:08.034 --> 00:01:11.037
'cause in reality, when you go
into the working force,

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:13.573
you don't get to pick
your coworkers.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.143
We both have ideas and we
combine them to do one thing.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.146
I also try to encourage them to
talk to other pairs if possible,

00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:22.115
but a lot of times,
I'll float around the room

00:01:22.182 --> 00:01:24.017
and kind of address issues
as they come up.

00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:26.419
So, how close are you guys
to getting the game playable?

00:01:26.486 --> 00:01:27.987
There are some students
who I pair

00:01:28.054 --> 00:01:29.222
who are on the same level.

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:31.524
There are other students
who are just plainly struggling,

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:34.727
and I try to put them
with a very high student

00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:38.231
so that they can maybe try to
absorb what this other student

00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:40.333
is doing and maybe get
some best practices.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.135
Go down their process,
how do they think,

00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:45.138
how do they accomplish a goal,
and try to get some of that

00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:48.174
into their own
programmatic thinking

00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:51.110
to really latch on
and build something together.

00:01:51.177 --> 00:01:55.248
He lets me improve my thing
at my own pace and my own style,

00:01:55.315 --> 00:01:58.284
so it's different
and it's its own creation.

00:01:58.351 --> 00:02:01.187
So, each group does get
different support from me

00:02:01.254 --> 00:02:03.256
depending on where they're at
level wise.

00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:05.325
So, it's just to get them
familiar with the idea

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:07.393
that when you leave high school,

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.096
this is something that runs true
throughout your life.

00:02:10.163 --> 00:02:11.331
You will always work
with a partner,

00:02:11.397 --> 00:02:12.432
you'll always work in groups.

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:15.068
Things are cooperative,
collaborative,

00:02:15.134 --> 00:02:18.805
and it's good to get that
mindset started for them now,

00:02:18.872 --> 00:02:20.373
because they're gonna need it.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.108
I do think it's easy
to learn something

00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:24.477
when working with others,
'cause they might know something

00:02:24.544 --> 00:02:26.212
that you don't know,
and you might know something

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:28.581
that they don't know, so you
guys can learn from each other.

00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:31.384
It helps us figure out things
that if we were by ourselves,

00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:33.319
we wouldn't be able to do
as easily.

00:02:33.386 --> 00:02:35.288
I think a journal
is definitely important,

00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:37.223
because we start on day one
with planning,

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.192
and I want them to understand
that planning

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:40.593
is part of the process.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.463
By giving me what you've done,
why you did it,

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.765
or how you did it,
that allows you

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:49.569
to think metacognitively
about what you did.

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:51.137
We describe what we did today,

00:02:51.204 --> 00:02:52.438
what kind of challenges
we faced,

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:54.374
like, how we could've
done this better,

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.608
what we should do tomorrow.

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:58.211
So, the idea that
they are documenting

00:02:58.278 --> 00:03:01.447
that process of change
really helps them see

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:04.651
that their programs,
their ideas aren't stagnant,

00:03:04.717 --> 00:03:07.921
that they are
an evolutionary process

00:03:07.987 --> 00:03:10.590
from day one
to the end of the project.

00:03:10.657 --> 00:03:13.326
I really want them
to get as much out of it

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:15.128
that isn't just
computer science,

00:03:15.194 --> 00:03:17.096
that's really thinking
outside the box.

00:03:17.163 --> 00:03:18.698
One of the overviews
of the school is making sure

00:03:18.765 --> 00:03:20.667
students are college
and career ready,

00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:24.437
and giving them that opportunity
to play around

00:03:24.504 --> 00:03:27.006
with computer science and get
to know coding and programming

00:03:27.073 --> 00:03:30.777
before they go off to college
we think is really valuable.

00:03:30.843 --> 00:03:32.111
The kids really buy into it.

00:03:32.178 --> 00:03:33.546
How in this game
are you attacking?

00:03:33.613 --> 00:03:34.981
They buy into it
when they own it.

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:35.982
I feel like
when you own something,

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:37.050
you're passionate about it.

00:03:37.116 --> 00:03:38.451
When you have
that kind of passion,

00:03:38.518 --> 00:03:41.487
you're more willing to put
the hours in to get it done.

00:03:41.554 --> 00:03:43.723
And the student interest
is there, so it's nice to have

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.792
the teacher interest
and the PD support.

00:03:45.858 --> 00:03:48.761
This is my first year teaching
AP Computer Science Principles.

00:03:48.828 --> 00:03:51.431
So, I kinda just jumped in,
dove in,

00:03:51.497 --> 00:03:53.099
you know, head first really.

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:54.500
I wanted to teach an AP course.

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:58.371
I was looking for something
to teach at a higher level

00:03:58.438 --> 00:04:00.506
that would also be
open and accepting

00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:01.741
of students of all levels.

00:04:01.808 --> 00:04:03.576
So, even though
it's an AP class,

00:04:03.643 --> 00:04:06.412
I have a student
from a D75 school.

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:08.147
I have students with IEPs,

00:04:08.214 --> 00:04:09.515
and then I have
the valedictorian.

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:13.686
So, the breadth of skill level
is very wide.

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:16.322
We accept everybody
and I think it's so accessible

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.992
that no matter what
your skill level is,

00:04:19.058 --> 00:04:21.427
you're gonna take something
out of this class.

00:04:21.494 --> 00:04:23.396
You're gonna leave this class

00:04:23.463 --> 00:04:25.264
being a better student,

00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:27.533
understanding what it means
to learn on your own,

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.669
to push yourself,
and I think that's the beauty

00:04:29.736 --> 00:04:33.473
of the Computer Science For All
curriculum.
