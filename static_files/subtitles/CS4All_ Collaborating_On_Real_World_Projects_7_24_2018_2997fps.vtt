00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:02.268
In our literacy class,

00:00:02.335 --> 00:00:03.570
we learn to take notes.

00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:05.772
So today, we're gonna
go deeper into researching

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:07.440
the three types of volcanoes.

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:10.310
What's one reason why
volcanoes are important?

00:00:10.377 --> 00:00:11.644
This is their blog.

00:00:11.711 --> 00:00:13.313
In the real world,

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.117
collaboration is necessary.

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:21.020
So, I wanted this
to be a replica

00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:24.357
of what happens
in the real world,

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:27.093
where we have people
who specialize

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.362
in different areas
come together

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.298
to teach the students
in their discipline.

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:33.767
Great.

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:36.369
♪

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:41.007
The three major parties
involved in this project

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:45.445
are myself,
I'm the literacy coach,

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:49.749
we have Mr.Tulli
who's the science teacher...

00:00:49.816 --> 00:00:51.317
-Minerals.
-Minerals, okay.

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:54.287
...and we have the classroom
fourth grade teacher,

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:55.755
Ms. Antoine.

00:00:55.822 --> 00:00:57.123
I think it's very important,

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.792
so I would write this
in my notes.

00:00:58.858 --> 00:01:02.128
And together
we're collaborating

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:05.698
and really guiding the students

00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:10.136
in researching
this particular project.

00:01:10.203 --> 00:01:13.239
The curriculum is all about

00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:16.509
volcanoes in Goma

00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:21.214
and how students can track

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:25.452
the activity of the volcano

00:01:25.518 --> 00:01:28.955
and also create
evacuation plans

00:01:29.022 --> 00:01:30.590
for the people of Goma.

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:33.993
This is the location of
this volcano we're studying.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.129
We Skype on a regular basis

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:38.665
with an outside team,
One Planet,

00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:42.368
and the chief executive officer
is George Newman.

00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:44.637
It is also right near
the volcano.

00:01:44.704 --> 00:01:48.508
We talk on a daily basis,
text each other,

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:51.377
send e-mails, and the purpose

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:55.648
was to help to make sure
that we were on track.

00:01:55.715 --> 00:01:57.550
Because of the project,

00:01:57.617 --> 00:02:02.755
scientists and other experts
in the field

00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:06.292
are in contact with us
on a regular basis.

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:09.329
Turn and talk about what else
you need to learn

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:10.797
about stratovolcano.

00:02:10.864 --> 00:02:13.466
We collaborated on
most of the lessons.

00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:15.101
We teach the lesson in class.

00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:17.036
The vocabulary words.

00:02:17.103 --> 00:02:19.239
Composite, strato.

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:22.408
Without soil,
what would be the problem?

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:24.177
-The plants wouldn't grow?
-Okay.

00:02:24.244 --> 00:02:27.380
And they research
and they share.

00:02:27.447 --> 00:02:30.283
"They are among the most common
types of volcanoes."

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.953
After sharing, you can see
every child is, like,

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.422
"I found this and I found that,"
you know?

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.492
The volcanoes are formed
by the lava.

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:41.361
Very good. Now...

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:42.762
♪

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.932
I decided that I want to learn

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.635
as much as I possibly could

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:51.204
about computer science,

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:55.608
so I enrolled in several
courses, workshops,

00:02:55.675 --> 00:03:00.179
and attended several workshops
with CS4All,

00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:04.317
and I just started
to become very fascinated

00:03:04.384 --> 00:03:07.587
with programming and coding,

00:03:07.654 --> 00:03:10.123
so I wanted to introduce it
to the students

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:12.091
because this is their future.

00:03:12.158 --> 00:03:14.928
The project is
a project-based learning

00:03:14.994 --> 00:03:16.763
incorporating STEM.

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.766
The science teacher
is responsible

00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:24.070
for the overall science
of the whole project.

00:03:24.137 --> 00:03:26.940
I take a small group
of students

00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:29.075
to teach them Scratch...

00:03:29.142 --> 00:03:31.678
Make sure you're following
your storyboard.

00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:33.279
...the coding part,

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:36.649
and also introducing them
to blogging.

00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:37.617
This whole generation,

00:03:37.684 --> 00:03:39.953
it was born with a mouse
in their hand

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.722
and they're very at ease
with technology,

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:44.524
and it really is the way
of the future,

00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:46.759
and I think there's so much
information out there.

00:03:46.826 --> 00:03:48.294
Now it's at their fingertips.

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:51.164
I'm working with a partner
named Solyssa

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.035
and we're using Scratch
to make a digital story

00:03:56.102 --> 00:03:59.138
to help the people in Goma
with the volcano.

00:03:59.205 --> 00:04:02.342
We get to get that information,

00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:04.978
what we learned in science,
and put it in the computer

00:04:05.044 --> 00:04:07.647
and then we made it
all into code.

00:04:07.714 --> 00:04:09.749
Two other people of the group,

00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:11.985
they're doing
the evacuation plan.

00:04:12.051 --> 00:04:15.188
So today, I was doing
the evacuation plan.

00:04:15.254 --> 00:04:16.923
It's gonna help lots of people.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.792
-Excellent.
-It's going to be on the blog.

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.462
I also heard that
it's going to scientists.

00:04:22.528 --> 00:04:25.198
They're gonna read it
and see if it could work.

00:04:25.264 --> 00:04:27.266
They're using
a variety of skill sets

00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:29.369
and their project,
you know, crosses through

00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:31.471
a variety of subject areas,

00:04:31.537 --> 00:04:33.172
and they're connecting
all of those

00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:36.142
to make meaning
and reach a goal.

00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:37.644
Kids are super engaged

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.947
because there's this
real-world connection,

00:04:41.014 --> 00:04:43.616
and learning is really about
preparing kids

00:04:43.683 --> 00:04:45.918
for the real world
and tuning them

00:04:45.985 --> 00:04:47.186
in to what's going on,

00:04:47.253 --> 00:04:49.455
and I think they were
really excited

00:04:49.522 --> 00:04:52.959
because their learning
right now is really connected.

00:04:53.026 --> 00:04:54.727
Computer science
is the catalyst

00:04:54.794 --> 00:04:56.596
for the whole project,

00:04:56.663 --> 00:05:00.433
and the kids are now
really interested

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.502
in computer science.

00:05:02.568 --> 00:05:04.570
They want to know how to code.

00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:09.142
They want to know how to do
other things in technology.

00:05:09.208 --> 00:05:12.311
So, this has been
a great experience for them.

00:05:12.378 --> 00:05:14.213
Excellent, excellent.
