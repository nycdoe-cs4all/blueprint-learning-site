WEBVTT

00:00:01.301 --> 00:00:04.337
We want to show you
how we integrated

00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:06.973
reading and computer science.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.975
♪

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:11.611
In today's performance,
I integrated computer science

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:14.080
with math, ELA,

00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:16.549
social studies, science,

00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:20.453
physical education, and dance.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.188
The students were
really, really excited

00:00:22.255 --> 00:00:23.523
about learning
about human rights

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.427
and they're also passionate
about computer science.

00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:29.729
Math was used
when we counted steps,

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:32.599
counted the loops,
looked at the step by step,

00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:34.801
and social studies,
'cause we're a community.

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:37.137
Let's all come together
and show everyone

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:39.639
how we can all get together.

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:42.976
So, today, my students
performed a showcase

00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:45.378
of what my class is doing
in the classroom.

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:47.414
Showing other students
in the school

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.749
what computer science
can look like.

00:00:49.816 --> 00:00:52.118
I want people to approach
computer science

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:53.787
as something that is accessible.

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:56.456
In computer science,
what we call that is a bug,

00:00:56.523 --> 00:01:00.093
but for us, it's choreography.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.229
I said to the students,
"This is not just choreography.

00:01:03.296 --> 00:01:04.964
This is something
you've done before.

00:01:05.031 --> 00:01:08.802
Now let's make it bigger and
find ways to create algorithms."

00:01:08.868 --> 00:01:10.437
And the kids are learning
about loops

00:01:10.503 --> 00:01:11.704
and how those things repeat.

00:01:11.771 --> 00:01:13.440
It's about the vocabulary
for computer science

00:01:13.506 --> 00:01:16.109
also coming through within
the dance and what that means.

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:18.244
Putting the concepts
into the students' bodies

00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:20.413
helps with recall,
because it allows students

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.949
to process and to think through

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:25.385
what it is that they're doing
and why they're doing it.

00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:27.554
If you notice, there were sports
activities that were in there,

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.055
so the students
were very active.

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:30.490
They got to see, "Wait a minute,

00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:34.127
when I'm actually involved
in a sports activity,

00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:35.795
computer science
is integrated with it."

00:01:35.862 --> 00:01:38.631
I thought it would be important
to show the unplugged aspect.

00:01:38.698 --> 00:01:40.433
Also for the students
to showcase

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.001
what they did with LED lights

00:01:42.068 --> 00:01:45.271
and how they integrated that
in their performance.

00:01:45.338 --> 00:01:47.307
So, I thought it was important
for the students to realize

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:50.777
that you can use computer
science in so many aspects,

00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:53.246
and so I wanted them to know
that kinesthetically,

00:01:53.313 --> 00:01:55.582
computer science
matters as well.

00:01:55.648 --> 00:01:58.585
(clapping)

00:01:58.651 --> 00:02:00.653
♪

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.322
So, today in reading,

00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:05.291
we're going to explain
how authors

00:02:05.358 --> 00:02:09.128
use reasons and evidence
to support their text.

00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:10.463
I feel like wherever
our students turn,

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.165
whichever teacher they go to,

00:02:12.232 --> 00:02:14.067
they're somehow using
computer science.

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:17.937
I'd like Kadija,
Elijah, and Isaiah

00:02:18.004 --> 00:02:19.772
to go to the computer over here.

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:22.475
So we're going to be looking at
Promises to Keep

00:02:22.542 --> 00:02:25.378
written by Sharon Robinson
about Jackie Robinson.

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:26.946
So we're trying to teach
the students,

00:02:27.013 --> 00:02:29.048
how do you go about

00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:31.251
convincing the reader

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:33.119
that your topic is important.

00:02:33.186 --> 00:02:35.321
So we'll be looking at
what Sharon Robinson

00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:37.657
had to say about her father,
Jackie Robinson,

00:02:37.724 --> 00:02:40.493
and her text is actually
an informational piece.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.295
And so, to put
computer science in there,

00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:45.398
I want students to choose
any sport that they like

00:02:45.465 --> 00:02:47.400
and create a project
in Scratch.

00:02:47.467 --> 00:02:49.736
And you guys will be creating
a digital story

00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:52.272
showing what type of barriers
you may have to face,

00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:54.674
what type of goals
did you have to achieve.

00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:58.011
It's gonna ask the boy what were
some of the barriers he faced.

00:02:58.077 --> 00:03:00.246
-Okay, that's good.
-So let's log in.

00:03:00.313 --> 00:03:02.949
I have the passwords up here
for Minecraft.

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:04.951

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:07.687
♪

00:03:07.754 --> 00:03:09.255
And in social studies today,

00:03:09.322 --> 00:03:11.724
we're using the Oregon Trail.

00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:14.561
So, today I'd like the students
to go into Minecraft

00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:17.597
and build a network
and work together,

00:03:17.664 --> 00:03:20.967
and see how are they getting
along in the Oregon Trail.

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:22.168
So, when we talk about the pony,

00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:24.304
what does that remind us
about the Oregon Trail?

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.506
That people had to travel here
by horseback.

00:03:26.573 --> 00:03:28.675
Technology surrounds them,
they have it in their hands.

00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:31.711
It's about being ready for the
future, being ready for life.

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:34.747
If you see a shot, don't think
that you can't make it

00:03:34.814 --> 00:03:36.616
and always try to make the shot.

00:03:36.683 --> 00:03:39.419
It's important for students
to be aware of computer science,

00:03:39.485 --> 00:03:41.955
because they're already creative
on their own,

00:03:42.021 --> 00:03:44.324
and computer science
is a medium for them

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.125
to express their creativity.

00:03:46.192 --> 00:03:48.094
Students really love
computer science,

00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:50.697
so it keeps them excited,
it keeps them motivated.

00:03:50.763 --> 00:03:53.366
The attendance is high,
and they said,

00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:54.467
"We can do this in class?"

00:03:54.534 --> 00:03:55.602
I said, "Absolutely."

00:03:55.668 --> 00:03:57.804
The students are really excited
to have

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.073
some ownership of their work

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:03.276
and to see computer science
come alive throughout their day.

00:04:03.343 --> 00:04:05.545
Oh, there's a beautiful garden!
