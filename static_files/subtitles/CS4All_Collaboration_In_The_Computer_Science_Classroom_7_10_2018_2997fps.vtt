00:00:01.334 --> 00:00:02.469
Please go to your station.

00:00:02.535 --> 00:00:04.337
If you're not sure
where your station is,

00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:06.406
please look at
the pocket charts.

00:00:06.473 --> 00:00:11.144
One robot and iPad
per partnership.

00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:13.313
So, let's see,
can we form a circle, friends?

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.982
My students really wanted
to work collaboratively

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.184
because the culture
that we have in our class

00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:21.087
is also one that--where
we promote collaboration.

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:24.424
It's one way to have
that sense of support

00:00:24.491 --> 00:00:26.926
that students can provide
to each other best

00:00:26.993 --> 00:00:29.662
and pair programming
has been very successful

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:33.066
because it allows kids to
really grow their vocabulary,

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.268
to be able to learn
how to debug,

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:37.036
and it really allows them

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:40.573
to work through a task
more carefully.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.208
It always helps
when you have a buddy

00:00:42.275 --> 00:00:46.212
to ask you to consider why
you're taking certain steps.

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:48.281
So, friends, can you please
have a discussion with June

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:50.583
to make sure that you are
all on the same page?

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.653
And I love it, you started
your reflection sheet.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.523
♪

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:00.293
So, friends, I'm gonna connect
to one of the robots.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.131
I was learning how to,
like, code Dash and Dot

00:01:05.198 --> 00:01:08.568
and go on the iPad
and program him

00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:09.936
to, like, move.

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:11.438
I think Dash
is my favorite station

00:01:11.504 --> 00:01:13.039
'cause it's
the most interactive.

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:15.408
We get to make--
use blocks of code

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:17.444
and code him to move around.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.548
So today, we had stations
highlighting pair programming.

00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:24.984
We had two stations where
they were exploring robotics.

00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:27.487
In one station,
they were programming Dash

00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:30.423
using a mat where
they were rolling a die

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.926
and selecting
different blocks of code

00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:35.094
to be able to perform
certain functions.

00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:38.665
The first station I was at
was Code.org

00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:41.234
and the second station was, um,

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:43.570
programming Colby the mouse.

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:46.039
The other station
with the robotic mouse,

00:01:46.105 --> 00:01:50.143
they were exploring
what the maze would be like

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.947
and also determining, like,
what the robot is capable of,

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:55.281
so it's more tangible

00:01:55.348 --> 00:01:57.617
and I wanted them to see
a different aspect

00:01:57.684 --> 00:01:59.219
of what coding can look like.

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:01.020
(robot mouse chittering)

00:02:01.087 --> 00:02:03.223
All of these lessons, really,
are just allowing kids

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:04.924
to be critical thinkers

00:02:04.991 --> 00:02:07.026
and to use their higher order
thinking skills

00:02:07.093 --> 00:02:08.428
and apply it
to some of the work

00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:09.362
that they're doing.

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.131
When you use pair programming,

00:02:11.197 --> 00:02:13.666
you have two roles
that are essential.

00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:15.735
The first role
is the driver's role

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:17.637
and the second role
is the navigator's role.

00:02:17.704 --> 00:02:22.242
The driver will be the student
who is operating the device

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:25.044
while the navigator is there
to provide directions

00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:26.746
and to basically help
the driver

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:28.248
navigate through the task.

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:31.384
And as the navigator
you can't touch the computer.

00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:33.219
You can't be a bossy navigator.

00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:34.587
I like to work with partners

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:37.223
because I feel that
it's a little funner

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.559
because maybe if
you don't know the code

00:02:39.626 --> 00:02:40.693
to the puzzle,

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.696
maybe, like, your f--
your partner can--knows,

00:02:43.763 --> 00:02:46.633
and then--and then, like,
you could solve it together.

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:48.568
I think that it's important
to work with my friends

00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:49.669
during computer science

00:02:49.736 --> 00:02:51.471
because if I get
stuck on something,

00:02:51.538 --> 00:02:53.139
I could ask them for some help.

00:02:53.206 --> 00:02:56.075
They learn how to be able
to take turns.

00:02:56.142 --> 00:02:59.212
They grow a lot
regarding their social skills.

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:00.480
Okay, please switch.

00:03:00.547 --> 00:03:02.181
When you're teaching
computer science,

00:03:02.248 --> 00:03:05.552
it's not just about being able
to come up with an algorithm.

00:03:05.618 --> 00:03:08.154
It's also being able
to collaborate

00:03:08.221 --> 00:03:10.924
to come up with
different possibilities

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.425
to solve a task.

00:03:12.492 --> 00:03:15.295
We do pair programming
throughout the day

00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:18.097
with every lesson
because we have students

00:03:18.164 --> 00:03:20.133
who connect on different tasks,

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:22.035
and it allows for
greater discussion

00:03:22.101 --> 00:03:23.736
of what the problem is.

00:03:23.803 --> 00:03:25.638
This is the world's
hardest game.

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:27.807
So, we foster that environment
in our school

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:30.376
starting from
the very first day of school.

00:03:30.443 --> 00:03:32.378
So, we spend the first
six weeks of school

00:03:32.445 --> 00:03:35.548
building community, and that's
really important work.

00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:38.017
And everything we do
after that

00:03:38.084 --> 00:03:40.086
stands on the shoulders
of that work.

00:03:40.153 --> 00:03:42.021
Computer science
is a great vehicle

00:03:42.088 --> 00:03:45.558
for collaboration
because you are working

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:48.127
to solve problems,
and problem-solving,

00:03:48.194 --> 00:03:49.762
having multiple perspectives,

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.264
really brings a lot
to the table.

00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:53.066
I was amazed.

00:03:53.132 --> 00:03:57.036
She had approximately
25 young children

00:03:57.103 --> 00:04:00.206
who were a community,

00:04:00.273 --> 00:04:02.308
and they all had
their functions

00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:05.678
and they all work
collaboratively

00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:07.447
and efficiently.

00:04:07.513 --> 00:04:09.048
What's the protocol? Show me.

00:04:09.115 --> 00:04:12.585
I love how she used
the visual signals

00:04:12.652 --> 00:04:16.522
a lot of times in place
of verbal instruction

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:17.790
for the kids.

00:04:17.857 --> 00:04:20.560
In class today,
I saw students working

00:04:20.627 --> 00:04:23.229
collaboratively together
in groups.

00:04:23.296 --> 00:04:26.399
She had students doing
Code.org on the laptops.

00:04:26.466 --> 00:04:28.601
She had mouse robot
on the tables.

00:04:28.668 --> 00:04:31.437
On the carpet, she had the
Dash robots being programmed.

00:04:31.504 --> 00:04:33.673
And then she had students
doing unplugged activities

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:34.707
on the tables.

00:04:34.774 --> 00:04:36.476
So, in that amount of space,

00:04:36.542 --> 00:04:39.579
to have all those things going
at one time was amazing.

00:04:39.646 --> 00:04:41.547
We need another
help desk attendant.

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:45.351
Some of the students
were help desk technicians

00:04:45.418 --> 00:04:47.186
and so they were
really responsible

00:04:47.253 --> 00:04:50.189
for helping the other students.

00:04:50.256 --> 00:04:53.326
This is for the help desk
in case someone needs help.

00:04:53.393 --> 00:04:56.195
So, like, if they need help,
they can--they can get me

00:04:56.262 --> 00:04:57.530
and then I can help them out.

00:04:57.597 --> 00:04:59.565
Constructive feedback
cannot exist

00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:01.000
unless you have an environment

00:05:01.067 --> 00:05:03.236
where people care
about each other

00:05:03.302 --> 00:05:06.305
and where they're invested
to be able to feel that

00:05:06.372 --> 00:05:08.007
what we're doing
with the feedback

00:05:08.074 --> 00:05:09.375
is promoting growth.

00:05:09.442 --> 00:05:12.078
A lot of the work we're doing
in computer science

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:14.547
is about teamwork
and collaboration,

00:05:14.614 --> 00:05:17.750
and children at all ages
need to learn how to do that,

00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:20.453
and it happens through
modeling and experiences

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.487
and practice.

00:05:21.554 --> 00:05:23.322
As you learn more
about each other,

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:24.691
you get to care more
about each other.

00:05:24.757 --> 00:05:27.994
So, being able to really
establish that is essential.

00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:30.129
I love computer science a lot.
