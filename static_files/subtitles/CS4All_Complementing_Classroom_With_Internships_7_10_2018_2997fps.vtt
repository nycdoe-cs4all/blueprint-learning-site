You try to find and correct
the bug in the code.

00:00:03.503 --> 00:00:05.372
A hint, something is missing.

00:00:05.438 --> 00:00:06.773
Can you figure that out?

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.677
I'm teaching
Computer Science Discoveries

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:12.579
to ninth graders,

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:15.749
and they're all working
on their own,

00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:17.817
but they need a lot of support.

00:00:17.884 --> 00:00:19.252
Good job.

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:22.288

Talk over your game ideas

We have an internship program
at Lincoln...

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:29.929
(unintelligible)

00:00:29.996 --> 00:00:33.233
...where students
are placed in workplaces,

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:37.570
and we were able to make this
a workplace experience

00:00:37.637 --> 00:00:39.072
for an internship.

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:41.741
I'm an intern and, um,

00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:44.144
what I do is I help kids
who are, like, stuck.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.447
I help fix their code
if they're having trouble.

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:50.683
So, Connery is an 11th grader
at Lincoln High School

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.719
who's completed
computer science courses

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:56.122
and is currently taking
a computer science course.

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:58.992
This computational thinking
is not something

00:00:59.058 --> 00:01:00.260
that they're used to

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:01.461
and it's not something
that they see

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:02.929
in their other classes.

00:01:02.996 --> 00:01:05.698
So, when you have
34 kids with laptops

00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:08.668
and they're all working on
these individual projects,

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:10.403
sometimes they need
a little bit of help.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.007
So, having that extra person
in the room with you,

00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:16.109
it's like,
"If I could duplicate myself

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:18.545
in the classroom,
what would I be doing?"

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:20.346
And that's what
the intern is doing.

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:23.516
It's important that this is
a workplace situation

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:26.052
because it lends an air
of seriousness

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.188
and responsibility.

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:29.923
They have a teacher's account,

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:32.959
so they have access to all
of the teacher materials

00:01:33.026 --> 00:01:34.928
and it's their job
to prepare,

00:01:34.994 --> 00:01:36.663
to understand the material,

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.932
to complete all
of the activities prior

00:01:38.998 --> 00:01:40.600
so that they can best help.

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:42.669
They have to come up
with questions

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:45.405
for how they're going to help
the students to understand

00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:46.739
without just
kind of being like,

00:01:46.806 --> 00:01:48.274
"Oh, well, just do this."

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:50.977
For this internship,
you can't really just show up.

00:01:51.044 --> 00:01:53.179
You need to prepare
for your classes.

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:55.348
They just place, like, in here.

00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:57.083
Like, it's gonna look weird
instead of the animation.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.518
Before we go
into the classroom,

00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:00.420
we review the lesson
and making sure

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:02.288
that we're correcting
each other

00:02:02.355 --> 00:02:03.456
on any mistakes that we have.

00:02:03.523 --> 00:02:04.591
All right, let's go in this one.

00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:07.460
We make sure that
we're gonna help students out

00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:09.496
by defining all
the major issues

00:02:09.562 --> 00:02:11.331
that they may have
in the lesson.

00:02:11.397 --> 00:02:13.466
They also forget
the set animation.

00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:16.636
The internship program
is really a cornerstone

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:21.307
for preparing our students
for college and career.

00:02:21.374 --> 00:02:24.110
Our students take
a junior year internship,

00:02:24.177 --> 00:02:26.012
work for one semester.

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.681
They'll leave school early
two afternoons a week

00:02:28.748 --> 00:02:29.949
to go to a business,

00:02:30.016 --> 00:02:32.285
a nonprofit,
or a government agency,

00:02:32.352 --> 00:02:35.922
a tech company, a hospital,
a police precinct,

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.758
a senior center,
a homeless shelter.

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:41.427
The guiding question,
really, for our program

00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:44.964
is when do adolescents know

00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:46.666
that they're becoming adults?

00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:49.135
The internship program
helps students

00:02:49.202 --> 00:02:51.004
make that transition.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.372
In a résumé,
you don't need a period

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:54.340
because they're
incomplete sentences anyway.

00:02:54.407 --> 00:02:57.544
By the end of the program,
students will be work-ready,

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.015
they'll have an
Abraham Lincoln-approved résumé,

00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:04.384
and then we help
to integrate them

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.252
into the job market.

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:07.787
This is all great stuff.

Computer science
is really well-suited

00:03:13.126 --> 00:03:14.761
for a workplace internship

00:03:14.827 --> 00:03:17.497
because you need more help
while you're learning it

00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:20.500
and it's more fun
and less frustrating

00:03:20.567 --> 00:03:22.569
while you're learning it,
which means that

00:03:22.635 --> 00:03:25.371
there's a better chance
you'd like to keep learning it

00:03:25.438 --> 00:03:27.941
and that you would remember
what you learned.

00:03:28.007 --> 00:03:29.242
Instead of relying
on a teacher,

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:32.178
you can learn from your peers,

00:03:32.245 --> 00:03:35.081
and it helps me
with my social skills.

00:03:35.148 --> 00:03:37.517
It's valuable for
all of the students

00:03:37.584 --> 00:03:40.720
on so many levels
to be working with each other,

00:03:40.787 --> 00:03:44.457
to have something in school
that they could aspire to do,

00:03:44.524 --> 00:03:47.927
to see other students
being professional,

00:03:47.994 --> 00:03:50.330

a--as a workplace

different grade levels.

the student.

something real

some kind of skills
