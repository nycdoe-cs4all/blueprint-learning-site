00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.001
Good morning, boys and girls.

00:00:02.068 --> 00:00:05.705
My computer science background
is almost zero.

00:00:05.772 --> 00:00:09.042
Even without being an expert
on computer science,

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:11.678
I rely heavily on technology.

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:16.249
Technology is what's
making the class

00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:17.517
such a success.

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:22.455
Technology has been
like a savior in my classroom.

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:24.224
To, like, start using
less blocks

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.226
and start using
the repeat blocks.

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:27.927
Excellent.

00:00:27.994 --> 00:00:31.765
♪

00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:33.266
The structure of the classroom,

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.135
if you want a mouse,
get a mouse,

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:37.404
you want headphones,
get a headphone.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.573
The mini lesson is done at
the SMART Board to begin with.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.976
Iman, come finish
this algorithm.

00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:46.312
The main program
they work with is Code.org.

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.183
So, everyone is focused on
the SMART Board,

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.286
trying to work through
a challenge together.

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:56.623
By doing it together,
they know that it's a program

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:58.391
that can be completed,

00:00:58.458 --> 00:01:01.394
it can be completed
in the allotted blocks

00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:03.396
that are required.

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:07.700
I also want them to see
that by working together

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:10.470
it's easier to get
something completed

00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:13.039
than trying to struggle
on their own.

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:15.141
That's why I call
many different people

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:18.244
to the SMART Board
to come assist,

00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:20.980
and even if somebody
get to the SMART Board

00:01:21.047 --> 00:01:23.750
and have problems,
you always can go

00:01:23.817 --> 00:01:26.719
and ask somebody
at their table to help.

00:01:26.786 --> 00:01:29.022
And, then, they have
the individual work

00:01:29.088 --> 00:01:31.491
that they do when they're
sitting at their computer.

00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:34.194
Instead of turning right,
which way did he turn?

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.197
One of the great things
about the classroom support

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:40.633
is I can, from my mainframe,

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.570
I can look at
everyone's computer,

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:46.206
see what everyone is doing,

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:48.441
and I can look through
the programs

00:01:48.508 --> 00:01:52.812
and seeing who's struggling,
so I really use that as a tool

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:55.482
to kind of get
the students past

00:01:55.548 --> 00:01:57.383
what it is that
they're going through.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.719
I think I have to move forward.

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:01.488
Okay, then you move forward.

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:04.657
I noticed that Gavin was
struggling at the same place

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:06.659
for a long period of time,

00:02:06.726 --> 00:02:09.395
and Abdou Rahim

00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:12.165
is a person that sits
next to him,

00:02:12.232 --> 00:02:14.334
and on many occasions,
I have seen them

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.169
look at each other's computer

00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:18.972
and kind of work
through problems together.

00:02:19.038 --> 00:02:23.109
So, when Gavin needed help,
it was just obvious to me,

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:25.044
like, let's call Abdou Rahim

00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:27.247
to kind of, like,
work with him.

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:28.948
Good to get help
from a friend

00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:31.284
because we both could learn.

00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:34.220
I learn from my classmate
what they tell me,

00:02:34.287 --> 00:02:36.756
and they learn from me
what I tell them,

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:38.925
what I tell them,
and I question them.

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:41.294
So, what do we need?

00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:42.428
Right.

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:45.265
Somebody tell me,
what is an algorithm?

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:46.799
♪

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:48.468
In my fifth grade class,

00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:51.504
half of the students
are using Code.org.

00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:54.107
Other half are using Codesters.

00:02:54.173 --> 00:02:56.309
Through the classroom
support system,

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:58.811
I was able to look
at my mainframe

00:02:58.878 --> 00:03:02.715
and notice that Ida
was struggling with Codesters.

00:03:02.782 --> 00:03:04.517
As I looked on to the computer,

00:03:04.584 --> 00:03:06.686
I noticed that Xavier

00:03:06.753 --> 00:03:09.789
was a little further than Ida,

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:14.160
and I felt it was a good match
to put those two together.

00:03:14.227 --> 00:03:18.164
I was giving suggestions,
and if one of my suggestions

00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:19.799
were partially right,

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:23.236
Ida would, like, kind of
help me to make sure.

00:03:23.303 --> 00:03:25.572
Well, we both tried
different ways

00:03:25.638 --> 00:03:28.608
to try to figure out
the problem,

00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:31.244
and once we got it,
we succeeded.

00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:35.682
I observed that the kids
had persistence.

00:03:35.748 --> 00:03:38.518
When they were up there

00:03:38.585 --> 00:03:40.787
doing the algorithms,

00:03:40.853 --> 00:03:44.157
I noticed that some of
the students were struggling,

00:03:44.223 --> 00:03:46.025
but they did not give up.

00:03:46.092 --> 00:03:49.495
They was constantly doing
the algorithm.

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:52.532
And this is what I like
about her classroom, too.

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.635
You didn't see Jody
too much teaching.

00:03:55.702 --> 00:03:58.237
The kids was up there
helping each other out.

00:03:58.304 --> 00:04:00.740
She was more like
the facilitator.

00:04:00.807 --> 00:04:03.176
In my classroom, in general,

00:04:03.242 --> 00:04:06.746
it's a culture
of collaboration.

00:04:06.813 --> 00:04:10.283
They know that
if they struggle,

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.251
their classmates
are there to help them,

00:04:12.318 --> 00:04:13.953
I'm there to help them.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.089
See? Because it's gonna
repeat it twice.

00:04:16.155 --> 00:04:19.559
My expectation is
you need help right now,

00:04:19.626 --> 00:04:22.629
but one day,
you're gonna be the person

00:04:22.695 --> 00:04:24.330
that's giving the help.

00:04:24.397 --> 00:04:26.299
We're adding, go up.

00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:29.402
Computer science,
it's a great success.

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:32.805
My kids and myself,
we have fun with it.

00:04:32.872 --> 00:04:35.808
They know that don't look
at Miss Hilton

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:37.944
for the answers all the time.

00:04:38.011 --> 00:04:39.579
Go to each other.

00:04:39.646 --> 00:04:42.348
And because of my weaknesses,

00:04:42.415 --> 00:04:44.717
the kids are being strong

00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:47.987

through this together.
