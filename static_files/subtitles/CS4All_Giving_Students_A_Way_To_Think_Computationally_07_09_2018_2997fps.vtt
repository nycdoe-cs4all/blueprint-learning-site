I try to bring to the students

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:32.332
a way to think about
how computers think...

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.567
When we originally defined
"algorithms,"

00:00:34.634 --> 00:00:38.037
we talked about it in terms of
this repeatable set of steps.

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:40.640
We compared it
to a cake recipe,

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:41.775
how you make a cake.

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:43.977
You gotta get the flour,
you gotta get the sugar,

00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:45.278
you gotta do all that,
put it together,

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:46.279
and then bake it.

00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:48.081

that we could understand

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:50.183
in terms of how we do anything.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.518
...and the way
in which I do that

00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:55.588
is by introducing them to
some basic concepts in logic,

00:00:55.655 --> 00:00:58.057
things that they do every day
when they make decisions,

00:00:58.124 --> 00:01:00.226
when they decide
to do certain things,

00:01:00.293 --> 00:01:03.163
and then apply it to a way
in which a computer

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.265
would process
that kind of information

00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:07.934
and show them
that computer science

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:10.236

communicate with humans

00:01:10.303 --> 00:01:13.606

of logical pattern.

He's--he's a good teacher.

The concept of logic

basic building blocks

Understanding
the basic of logic

at a fundamental level

00:02:18.438 --> 00:02:20.940
how computers operate
so that we can manipulate

00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:23.309

more efficient algorithm

algorithms

a little differently.

programs in Snap

deductive argument

and that demonstrate
inductive argument.

00:02:49.402 --> 00:02:51.437
They can apply that to

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:55.375
both their practical
programming,

coding, and computing,

It's level of abstraction,
excellent.

I try to design
my lessons around

00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:09.589
what I think they can absorb
and go a little bit more

00:03:09.656 --> 00:03:12.959
and keep them engaged
by challenging them to think

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:16.062
a little bit beyond
just, you know, the facts

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:18.131
or the information
that I provide.

00:03:18.197 --> 00:03:20.533
Manuel, let's check this.
I'm gonna put you on the spot.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.636
He didn't use long examples,
so it was three statements.

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:26.773
If this, then that,
therefore it must be.

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:28.308
All vegetables are plants.

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:29.609
-True.
-True?

00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:31.277
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

00:03:31.344 --> 00:03:32.312
Tomato is a vegetable.

00:03:32.378 --> 00:03:34.414
-Yeah.
-No, it's a fruit.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.548
Uh-oh.

00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:37.784
I love the tomato, you know,

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.386
because there's always the, uh,

00:03:40.453 --> 00:03:42.088
is it a fruit
or is it a vegetable?

00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:44.324
Again, when it broke it down,
they had to think about it,

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.259
so it wasn't
just him lecturing.

00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:48.094
They had to come up
and why is it, you know,

00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:51.064
and if that is true,
then therefore it must be.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.368
Let me show you this video
from Monty Python.

00:03:55.435 --> 00:03:57.704
I really liked how he brought
in the real-life examples.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.940
I liked how he had
the Monty Python video clip.

00:04:01.007 --> 00:04:04.344
There are ways of telling
whether she's a witch.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.311
Are there?

00:04:05.378 --> 00:04:06.946
Monty Python was awesome.

00:04:07.013 --> 00:04:08.815
It--it kept it flowing.

00:04:08.881 --> 00:04:13.720
If she weighs
the same as a duck...

00:04:15.855 --> 00:04:17.457
...she's made of wood!

00:04:17.523 --> 00:04:20.126
And therefore...

00:04:20.193 --> 00:04:21.561
-A witch!
-A witch!

00:04:21.628 --> 00:04:24.664
(cheering)

00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:27.166
Deductive or inductive?

00:04:27.233 --> 00:04:29.168
So, it's possible
she's a witch.

00:04:29.235 --> 00:04:30.670
We don't know until
we perform the test.

00:04:30.737 --> 00:04:33.339
Now we can argue
whether the test is foolproof,

00:04:33.406 --> 00:04:34.273
but it's there.

You cannot do computer science
