00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.369
So, I said,
"Write a pseudocode,"

00:00:02.435 --> 00:00:04.504
but you're gonna actually use
your laptops.

00:00:04.571 --> 00:00:06.606
Move three units forward
and turn right.

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:08.375
Move two blocks...

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:09.576
Go to the Do-Now.

00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:12.712
Students are
going to do a Do-Now,

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:17.684
so they're going to use
themselves as the tool

00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:19.753
in order to perform a task.

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:22.956
For you, you, personally,
to walk in a square.

00:00:23.022 --> 00:00:27.160
One, two, three, four.

00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:31.131
♪

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:33.099
My name is Robert Calungsod.

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.467
I teach Algebra II

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:37.203
and also Computer Science
and Robotics.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.705
So, if you want to move
to the side,

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:39.773
then you change the "Y."

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:42.542
So, the Do-Now
is actually individual.

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:44.744
The students will have
their own laptops.

00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:46.780
They're going to type
the steps

00:00:46.846 --> 00:00:49.449
in order to walk in squares.

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:52.152
Basically, what we did
is we made an algorithm,

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:55.321
so the Do-Now asks us
to write a script

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:58.458
of someone or an object,
anything, to walk in a square.

00:00:58.525 --> 00:01:01.494
So, we went on Microsoft Word,
we made a pseudocode.

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:04.397
Pseudocode is actually
the representation

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:06.633
or the steps in English.

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:09.302
Writing out the pseudocode
is valuable

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.805
because it's kind of easier
to identify errors.

00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:13.039
Especially writing it down,

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:14.808
when you write down
the pseudocode,

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:16.543
like, you see exactly
what you're writing,

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:18.077
you need to see
exactly what it takes

00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:19.345
to execute your plan,

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:20.814
so a pseudocode
definitely helps.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.949
It's basically like a draft
to whatever you're doing.

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:25.285
These are the other steps
on the board.

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:28.288
And then I'm going to show
one of the computer screens

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:32.025
on the board
and then ask another student

00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:34.360
to perform the steps.

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:36.429
I call another student

00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:39.933
to perform the steps

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:41.768
instead of that student
because, sometimes,

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:44.170
the students will rationalize,

00:01:44.237 --> 00:01:46.206
and a computer
doesn't rationalize.

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:47.974
It just follows them.

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:50.176
So that removes the bias.

00:01:50.243 --> 00:01:52.145
Basically, whatever they wrote,

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:53.947
that's what they perform.

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:56.082
That's the same pseudocode
that you're going to implement

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:57.250
using choreograph.

00:01:57.317 --> 00:01:59.552
Today, they're going
to use choreograph

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.490
because that's the language
that is going to be used

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:05.058
to talk to the robot.

00:02:05.124 --> 00:02:08.561
Then, they're going to
demonstrate their pseudocode...

00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:11.564
You have to do it
based on what is in there.

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:15.068
...and they're going to do it
in the front of the class.

00:02:15.134 --> 00:02:16.369
I...

00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:18.638
♪

00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:20.607
Each step is going
to be recorded.

00:02:20.673 --> 00:02:22.675
For example, they're going
to say walk straight

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:23.710
for how many steps.

00:02:23.776 --> 00:02:25.645
Four steps,
one, two, three, four.

00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:27.180
That's what they can do.

00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:30.717
So, the next step should be
based on what they plan to do

00:02:30.783 --> 00:02:32.552
in order to solve the problem.

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:36.489
So, it leads to the student
thinking about the algorithm,

00:02:36.556 --> 00:02:40.360
about the steps it takes
in order to perform the task.

00:02:40.426 --> 00:02:42.428
I'm like, "Okay, I've gotten
this down pat.

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:44.397
Maybe I can face the next one."

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:48.468
So, we have a little robot,
a humanoid robot called Nao.

00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:52.805
The angle, the data
is actually what you use.

00:02:52.872 --> 00:02:55.475
We're going to use
the pseudocode

00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:58.778
and program our robot

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:02.348
in order to do the same task
as what they did.

00:03:02.415 --> 00:03:03.449
But what we were
doing earlier,

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:04.651
we have to figure out
how we can make

00:03:04.717 --> 00:03:06.286
the robot walk in a square.

00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:10.056
Like, I made it go
three units forward

00:03:10.123 --> 00:03:11.457
and turn right.

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:15.461
So, you click "play,"
it's going to move forward,

00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:17.697
and then look what happens.

00:03:17.764 --> 00:03:20.600
So, that's 90 degrees.

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:23.369
This class is AP
Computer Science Principles.

00:03:23.436 --> 00:03:25.071
The skill levels are varied,

00:03:25.138 --> 00:03:28.474
so it's always giving them
different tasks,

00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:31.210
not to lose
the lower level ones,

00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:34.314
and also give extra tasks
for those students

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.916
who are advanced.

00:03:36.983 --> 00:03:38.985
If we're in the business
of preparing our children

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:40.787
for the future,
we have to have

00:03:40.853 --> 00:03:42.922
a viable computer
science program.

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.659
The students are actually
building, developing, coding,

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:49.162
and creating the language
of science,

00:03:49.228 --> 00:03:50.697
and that will
hopefully help them

00:03:50.763 --> 00:03:52.765
in terms of mathematics.

00:03:52.832 --> 00:03:55.501
What's the mathematical
principle that involves this?

00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:57.704
What I like about
computer science

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.039
is being able to overcome
an obstacle.

00:04:00.106 --> 00:04:02.175
So, you're turning
in a--into a circle.

00:04:02.241 --> 00:04:04.210
So, that's really what I enjoy
because, you know,

00:04:04.277 --> 00:04:06.112
struggling through it
is a little difficult,

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:08.948
but once I overcome it,
I feel good.

00:04:09.015 --> 00:04:11.551
Because the students
are in various levels,

00:04:11.618 --> 00:04:15.188
it is very important
for the student to know

00:04:15.254 --> 00:04:17.757
and to understand,
"Oh, these are the steps."

00:04:17.824 --> 00:04:19.692
When they perform it
physically,

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:22.362
like them walking in a square,

00:04:22.428 --> 00:04:26.399
they can actually perceive
the steps necessary to do it

00:04:26.466 --> 00:04:30.470
so, therefore, the physical
aspect is helpful.

00:04:30.536 --> 00:04:31.738
I really like the fact

00:04:31.804 --> 00:04:34.240
that the students
were very engaged.

00:04:34.307 --> 00:04:36.309
Doing the lesson
like Robert had,

00:04:36.376 --> 00:04:38.177
they followed directions
very well

00:04:38.244 --> 00:04:42.181
and they do like to act out
whatever plan that they have

00:04:42.248 --> 00:04:43.616
from a think map.

00:04:43.683 --> 00:04:45.518
That was amazing.

00:04:45.585 --> 00:04:48.921
I always tell them that
if you have the work ethic,

00:04:48.988 --> 00:04:50.390
then we can
work it out together

00:04:50.456 --> 00:04:53.092
and, eventually,
it will lead to success.

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:55.662
But it's amazing,
you'll see them, "Oh, oh, oh,"

00:04:55.728 --> 00:04:57.130
and then they have
these sounds...

00:04:57.196 --> 00:04:58.698
(laughs)

00:04:58.765 --> 00:05:01.000
...'cause they're happy
if they get the answer.

00:05:01.067 --> 00:05:03.269
I wrote the original code
and it actually worked.

00:05:03.336 --> 00:05:06.506
I've been with Mr. C.
for about six months now

00:05:06.572 --> 00:05:08.107
and his way of teaching
has really helped me

00:05:08.174 --> 00:05:09.542
and improved
my way of thinking.

00:05:09.609 --> 00:05:12.445
So, as a teacher,
I always feel proud

00:05:12.512 --> 00:05:14.080
when something
like this happens.

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:18.418
You do everything in here
and then you add it to "X."
