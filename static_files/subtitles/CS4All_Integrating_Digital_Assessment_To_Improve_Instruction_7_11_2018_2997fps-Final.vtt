00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:03.002
Last week we were working
on Lesson Three.

00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:04.404
Can you press the Enter key?

00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:05.672
Can you check on your
Sown To Grow for me?

00:00:05.739 --> 00:00:08.074
As a specialist,
I see 20 classes,

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:10.443
I teach 500 or so students.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.078
It's a lot to keep track of.

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:13.613
I have a paperless classroom,

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.482
and I think
that's fairly important

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:17.050
in a one-to-one
digital environment,

00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:19.419
really leveraging technology
for everything it can do

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:22.455
and using it to help kids
be organized,

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:25.158
for me to be organized,
to have accountability.

00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:28.128
♪

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:30.730
iDoceo, it's like
my one-stop-shop.

00:00:30.797 --> 00:00:33.366
I used to just have a bunch
of binders and papers,

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:36.169
and as you see, I've tried
to minimize a lot of that.

00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:40.607
I just really wanted a way
to have everything in one place.

00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:42.742
I like this one
'cause I see kids once a week.

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.144
So, I can easily toggle back

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.745
and see what did we do
last week.

00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:47.680
And, you know,
the expectation for us

00:00:47.747 --> 00:00:51.151
is to provide this personalized
learning experience

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:53.620
where we know each child
as an individual.

00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:55.922
Even just learning
500 kids' names,

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.590
you know, it's super helpful
to like, be like,

00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:00.693
your name and picture, and now
I have a name to the face.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.130
So, I really felt like this tool

00:01:04.197 --> 00:01:06.566
has helped me to do
a better job at that.

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:10.069
It has my schedule set up,
all the weeks of the year.

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:11.971
I have my lesson plans in there.

00:01:12.038 --> 00:01:13.239
I have my grade book in there.

00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:14.707
I can keep notes on students.

00:01:14.774 --> 00:01:16.576
I can take anecdotal evidence,

00:01:16.643 --> 00:01:18.978
like photos and video.

00:01:19.045 --> 00:01:21.381
I like that you're using
the diary feature

00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:22.949
as a way to store your lessons.

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:25.952
I hadn't thought of it that way,
that's a nice take on it.

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:28.254
I like the fact that

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:30.423
you have access
to your lesson plans,

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.059
your grade book,
and everything's in one place.

00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:35.728
So, it seems like an easy way

00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:38.665
to, you know,
have information on students

00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:40.366
and keep yourself organized.

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:42.235
And then for the numeric grade,

00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:44.737
I put just a simple
numeric grade

00:01:44.804 --> 00:01:46.406
out of the total number
of puzzles.

00:01:46.473 --> 00:01:48.708
And then it does
the calculations for me.

00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:51.077
This is another thing
that is amazing.

00:01:51.144 --> 00:01:52.612
What should we always do

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:55.248
when we're starting
a new lesson activity?

00:01:55.315 --> 00:01:58.384
Um, you go to Sown To Grow
and set a goal.

00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:02.255
Sown To Grow is a goal-setting
and reflection tool.

00:02:02.322 --> 00:02:03.923
This is a student-facing tool.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.458
It's not just teacher-facing.

00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:07.427
It's teacher-facing
and student-facing.

00:02:07.494 --> 00:02:09.395
Here they're actively involved

00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:11.364
in their growth mindset process,

00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:14.300
and it tracks it all and keeps
it in one place for them.

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:17.470
When you start new things,
you have to go on Sown To Grow

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:20.106
and it already says,
like, the thing you're doing.

00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:22.809
And then you click that,

00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:24.777
and then you just set your goal.

00:02:24.844 --> 00:02:28.248
Everyone uses it
to either set goals

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:30.416
for a lesson you wanna do,

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:34.721
add score to--
like, from Google Classroom,

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:37.991
or reflect, like reflect
on a lesson you did.

00:02:38.057 --> 00:02:41.761
The goal makes me feel
more confident in what I do.

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:45.965
When I reflect, you can see
what your strategies were

00:02:46.032 --> 00:02:48.067
and then you can use
those strategies

00:02:48.134 --> 00:02:51.037
on the ones you're stuck on.

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:54.240
The way I started, and what
I think really got them hooked

00:02:54.307 --> 00:02:57.277
was talking about it
in a broader sense, you know,

00:02:57.343 --> 00:03:00.146
about how we set goals for
anything we wanna accomplish.

00:03:00.213 --> 00:03:02.715
I used examples that they could
connect to their real lives

00:03:02.782 --> 00:03:04.918
like learning
to ride a bike or,

00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:06.986
you know, learning to walk.

00:03:07.053 --> 00:03:08.621
What we're really trying to do
here in school,

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:11.558
it's beyond learning
some technology skills.

00:03:11.624 --> 00:03:13.092
We wanna teach them to think

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:16.429
and teach them to be
independent learners.

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:20.033
I tell them that I still ask
for help all the time

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.435
and that it really takes a team.

00:03:22.502 --> 00:03:24.504
You know, no one makes it
on their own.

00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:26.372
Love it, using collaboration
and communication.

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:29.542
I post everything that
we work on on Google Classroom.

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.711
So, I got my Google
Classroom app here.

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:34.080
Which also allows me to
differentiate, which is great.

00:03:34.147 --> 00:03:36.816
So, I have different assignments
posted for different kids.

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:39.385
We will go over what objectives

00:03:39.452 --> 00:03:40.954
they're gonna be learning
in the unit.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.422
So, we do that together,

00:03:42.488 --> 00:03:44.324
and we kinda talk it out,

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.025
and I ask if they have
any questions.

00:03:46.092 --> 00:03:47.126
And they do a check-in.

00:03:47.193 --> 00:03:48.428
How are they feeling?

00:03:48.494 --> 00:03:50.330
And if they're not feeling good
I can check in with them

00:03:50.396 --> 00:03:52.398
and find out why
they're not feeling good.

00:03:52.465 --> 00:03:53.633
It affects learning.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.268
Okay, great, use Set Goals.

00:03:55.335 --> 00:03:57.971
For each lesson activity,
they set a goal

00:03:58.037 --> 00:04:00.607
and it'll show up to them
as a color-coded scale,

00:04:00.673 --> 00:04:03.643
and they can choose Get Close,

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.812
Meet, or Exceed.

00:04:05.878 --> 00:04:07.380
And then they can write
a little bit

00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:10.149
about how they might plan
to achieve that goal.

00:04:10.216 --> 00:04:12.118
And there's also a link
to sample strategies,

00:04:12.185 --> 00:04:14.454
so if they're not sure
what strategies to use

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.357
they can look at some examples
to get ideas.

00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:20.193
And that is customizable,
so we've actually been building

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:23.196
our own strategies,
and kids have been contributing

00:04:23.262 --> 00:04:26.032
and adding to that
strategy bank, which is great,

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:28.067
'cause I think it's really
giving them some ownership.

00:04:28.134 --> 00:04:29.702
That's a good one,
I think I'm gonna add that

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:31.104
to the list of strategies.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.705
In that sense,
we're like a learning community

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:34.107
and we're helping each other.

00:04:34.173 --> 00:04:36.275
Can you give me a "yes"
in sign language?

00:04:36.342 --> 00:04:37.977
All these kids are working on
different things.

00:04:38.044 --> 00:04:40.246
I've asked them to let me know
and communicate with me

00:04:40.313 --> 00:04:42.682
when they've completed
something, and I can come

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:45.818
and look at their screen
or I can look at my screen

00:04:45.885 --> 00:04:48.488
and look at their progress,
and then I will grade it

00:04:48.554 --> 00:04:50.189
and post their grades
on Google Classroom.

00:04:50.256 --> 00:04:52.158
I like to do it with the kids,
because then they're there

00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:53.960
and they can see
exactly what I'm doing.

00:04:54.027 --> 00:04:56.229
And I'll also just toggle over
on my iPad

00:04:56.295 --> 00:04:58.398
to the Classroom app,
the Google Classroom app,

00:04:58.464 --> 00:05:01.067
type in their grade and send it
to them immediately.

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:03.636
So, I've told them verbally
and I've also recorded it

00:05:03.703 --> 00:05:05.471
for them in a place
where they know to get it,

00:05:05.538 --> 00:05:07.040
and then they'll take that grade

00:05:07.106 --> 00:05:09.609
and they have to actually
type it themselves,

00:05:09.676 --> 00:05:11.611
which really makes it
click for them.

00:05:11.678 --> 00:05:15.715
And then they can go
and immediately log it,

00:05:15.782 --> 00:05:18.217
reflect on it,
think about what strategies

00:05:18.284 --> 00:05:21.587
they need to use or that they
did use that are successful.

00:05:21.654 --> 00:05:24.223
And they can move on
to the next thing

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.292
or do a Fast Finisher activity.

00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:29.362
I think there's definitely value
in tracking

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:32.131
what concepts and skills
you've mastered,

00:05:32.198 --> 00:05:34.467
because that's really
what's gonna matter in life.

00:05:34.534 --> 00:05:36.469
Not your 90 or not your 60.

00:05:36.536 --> 00:05:38.638
I think it's training
their brain

00:05:38.705 --> 00:05:42.308
to be in that cycle
of this goal-setting,

00:05:42.375 --> 00:05:44.577
checking in and evaluating,

00:05:44.644 --> 00:05:47.814
reflecting, using strategies,
making changes,

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.583
adjusting,
building their confidence.

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.554
It helps kid to know
what concepts and what skills

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.790
they're learning and where
they are in their continuum

00:05:57.857 --> 00:06:01.961
towards mastery of those skills
and those concepts.
