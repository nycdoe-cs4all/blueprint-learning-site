WEBVTT

00:00:00.867 --> 00:00:02.635
All right, so I'm gonna
call you to the meeting area

00:00:02.702 --> 00:00:05.572
like we normally do.

00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:07.607
We're gonna be using
the robots today.

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:09.676
We're big on letting
the kids know

00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:10.677
everything that's going on.

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:11.978
We're gonna be practicing

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:13.813
what we've been doing
with algorithms.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.515
So, we always start
by letting them know

00:00:15.582 --> 00:00:17.050
our expectations...

00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:19.219
So, I have some Smarties
'cause I'm gonna be

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:22.155
giving them out to people
with smart answers.

00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:23.923
...and then having
the kids know

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.759
what their expectations
are for the lessons.

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:28.194
So, I want to start
by going over

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:30.597
what we remember
about algorithms.

00:00:30.663 --> 00:00:32.065
♪

00:00:32.132 --> 00:00:35.001
We're going to watch
a video on algorithms

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:36.336
from Flocabulary,

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:38.638
and we're gonna learn
about algorithms again,

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:41.608
and you're gonna tell me
if you learned anything new.

00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:44.611
♪ A set of steps
written with precision ♪♪

00:00:44.677 --> 00:00:46.179
I learned some new things.

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:47.814
I want you to take
a minute to think.

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:50.617
We usually go
right into a discussion,

00:00:50.683 --> 00:00:52.285
so I give them think time

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:54.020
and I give them
turn and talk time.

00:00:54.087 --> 00:00:56.022
So, if you allow think time
for students,

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.258
it helps them focus
what they want to say.

00:00:58.324 --> 00:00:59.626
They practice it
in their head.

00:00:59.692 --> 00:01:03.263
Turn and talk,
and discuss what it is.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.632
The teacher asks you a question

00:01:05.698 --> 00:01:07.200
and then she tells you
to think,

00:01:07.267 --> 00:01:09.035
and then we switch

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:11.070
and then we tell the person
what we think.

00:01:11.137 --> 00:01:13.306
You're gonna hold all
the paperwork for your group.

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:16.176
So, in our school,
they're very big

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:19.479
on learning progressions
and every child learning

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:21.014
to their learning progression.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.750
So, the way to do that,
I feel, in my classroom,

00:01:23.817 --> 00:01:26.786
is by color coding things
so they don't panic as much

00:01:26.853 --> 00:01:28.688
and they know
that they can do it,

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:31.458
they just have to productively
struggle through.

00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:34.227
And it also gives them
growth mindset

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:36.162
to come out of that progression

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.398
and to try to get
into the next progression

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:41.067
by giving me their best effort
in their work.

00:01:41.134 --> 00:01:44.204
So, in this lesson,
the activity was for them

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.208
to create algorithms
by rolling a die.

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:51.744
Each number from the die
matched up to a piece of code.

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:54.414
So, when they rolled the die,
they were able to choose

00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:57.317
one of those blocks
from the Blockly app

00:01:57.383 --> 00:01:58.918
and make it part
of their algorithm.

00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:01.154
And they created
a random algorithm

00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:03.656
and they were supposed to play
their algorithm on Dash,

00:02:03.723 --> 00:02:04.657
watch what he does,

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:06.459
and then write
about what he did.

00:02:06.526 --> 00:02:09.062
So, it was just a fun way
of getting them engaged

00:02:09.128 --> 00:02:12.265
and learning that the codes
create an algorithm for Dash.

00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:14.100
I would make an algorithm,

00:02:14.167 --> 00:02:16.669
and then I would send it
to the robot

00:02:16.736 --> 00:02:19.038
and then tap its head,

00:02:19.105 --> 00:02:20.940
and then I would--
then it would do

00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:24.077
what I told it to do.

00:02:24.143 --> 00:02:26.479
I really liked how
she was able to control

00:02:26.546 --> 00:02:29.516
the amount of robots
in one room

00:02:29.582 --> 00:02:33.186
by limiting the blocks
that they were able to use.

00:02:33.253 --> 00:02:35.488
Remember, you have to send it
to him first.

00:02:35.555 --> 00:02:37.557
She was really focused
on just using blocks

00:02:37.624 --> 00:02:39.959
that kept the robots
in one spot.

00:02:40.026 --> 00:02:42.495
She was able to really use
a lot of devices

00:02:42.562 --> 00:02:44.130
in a small space.

00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:46.499
So, another management tool
that I have

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:48.635
are these flip books,
and the flip books

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:52.105
are there for the students,
and instead of raising hands,

00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:54.007
I ask them to use
the flip books.

00:02:54.073 --> 00:02:55.575
And the flip books
have three colors,

00:02:55.642 --> 00:02:58.244
so the green color means
that they're doing fine

00:02:58.311 --> 00:02:59.345
and they don't need a teacher.

00:02:59.412 --> 00:03:01.014
If I see a group
that's on yellow

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.248
and they flip it to yellow,

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:04.183
it means they do need
a teacher,

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.785
but it's not an emergency

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:07.754
and they can keep working
until I'm ready.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.489
Can I turn this back to green?

00:03:09.556 --> 00:03:10.290
Okay.

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:11.524
And if they're on red,

00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:13.393
I know to go to those groups
right away

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.261
because they can't
continue anything

00:03:15.328 --> 00:03:16.496
until a teacher helps.

00:03:16.563 --> 00:03:18.097
You guys are gonna write down
what happened now,

00:03:18.164 --> 00:03:19.666
so talk about it together
as a group

00:03:19.732 --> 00:03:21.000
and write down what happened.

00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:25.004
Once you have all
your paperwork settled,

00:03:25.071 --> 00:03:28.308
come in a discussion circle.

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:29.609
The discussion circles

00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:32.211
are usually one giant
classroom circle

00:03:32.278 --> 00:03:34.213
and the reason for this
is because I want the kids

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.384
to be able to start practicing
eye contact and body language,

00:03:38.451 --> 00:03:40.086
and they need
to see each other.

00:03:40.153 --> 00:03:43.923
And I was noticing that
students are very shy.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.391
So, when you give a child
a microphone,

00:03:45.458 --> 00:03:47.794
I feel like immediately
their confidence goes up...

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.596
-So cool.
-...they're excited

00:03:49.662 --> 00:03:50.697
about what they're doing,

00:03:50.763 --> 00:03:52.065
and because it's
on a microphone,

00:03:52.131 --> 00:03:53.700
the rest of the class
is also watching

00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:55.201
and they're paying
attention more.

00:03:55.268 --> 00:03:57.236
I ask them to challenge
each other

00:03:57.303 --> 00:03:59.038
by not only telling me
what they did,

00:03:59.105 --> 00:04:01.074
but I have other groups
challenge that group

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.709
by asking them a HOTS question,

00:04:02.775 --> 00:04:05.244
which is a higher order
thinking question,

00:04:05.311 --> 00:04:06.646
about what they just said.

00:04:06.713 --> 00:04:10.083
Did you have any struggles,
and if you did and why?

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:12.685
In my coding classes,
I provide the children

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:15.388
with time to do journaling.

00:04:15.455 --> 00:04:16.656
When you're journaling,

00:04:16.723 --> 00:04:20.426
you think of what
you're going to write about

00:04:20.493 --> 00:04:22.795
and you're thinking
what coding is.

00:04:22.862 --> 00:04:26.933
I like the journal
because it--I can look back

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.701
and see my memories.

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:30.536
And the journaling, for me,
is a way for them

00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:32.739
to express themselves
and for me to see

00:04:32.805 --> 00:04:36.976
how they feel about a topic
that we're doing at that time

00:04:37.043 --> 00:04:38.344
or their understanding.

00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:40.747
So, sometimes it might be
something that I ask them

00:04:40.813 --> 00:04:42.081
and I need them to answer,

00:04:42.148 --> 00:04:44.017
and I use it
as a form of assessment,

00:04:44.083 --> 00:04:46.486
and other times, it's just
a way for them to share

00:04:46.552 --> 00:04:47.687
because I can't get
to everybody

00:04:47.754 --> 00:04:49.222
in a discussion circle.

00:04:49.288 --> 00:04:51.724
And other times, it's just
a way for them to celebrate

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:53.159
something good that happened

00:04:53.226 --> 00:04:55.395
or just kind of
go through the day

00:04:55.461 --> 00:04:57.563
and kind of figure out
and reflect upon

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.132
what they need to work on.

00:04:59.198 --> 00:05:02.435
Her use of, um,
the launch of her lesson,

00:05:02.502 --> 00:05:05.104
she used a video
and she used--

00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:07.807
she really activated
the students' prior knowledge

00:05:07.874 --> 00:05:09.509
and she brought that
to the table.

00:05:09.575 --> 00:05:11.778
I really liked
how Megan was able

00:05:11.844 --> 00:05:15.782
to make the kids accountable
for all their learning.

00:05:15.848 --> 00:05:16.983
They had checklists,

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.986
they had criteria
that they had to follow,

00:05:20.053 --> 00:05:21.387
and I think it was
a really valuable tool

00:05:21.454 --> 00:05:24.257
that I plan to use
when I go back to my school.

00:05:24.323 --> 00:05:26.759
I like that I'm adding
to opportunities

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:28.561
for their careers
in the future,

00:05:28.628 --> 00:05:31.230
and I just can tell
that the kids are so into it,

00:05:31.297 --> 00:05:33.032
and I get so much more
out of them

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:36.235
during coding lessons
than in any other subjects.

00:05:36.302 --> 00:05:37.970
In other subjects,
I sometimes tell them

00:05:38.037 --> 00:05:39.539
exactly what they need
to change,

00:05:39.605 --> 00:05:41.607
whereas in computer science,
they're coming up with ideas

00:05:41.674 --> 00:05:43.509
that I would have never
even thought of.

00:05:43.576 --> 00:05:47.046
Why don't we come up
with our own ideas?
